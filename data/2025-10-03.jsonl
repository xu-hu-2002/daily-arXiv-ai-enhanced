While recent advances in\nlarge language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain\ninaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,\npre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we\nargue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,\nwhere AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than\nstatic datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,\nparticularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond\nstatic data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven\ndiscovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration\ninstead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework\ngrounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty\nfrom the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers\nto guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal\nfine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes\ncontext labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the\nembedding and generator models is required."}

This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial\nfor factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure\nthis ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by\nrefusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different\nrefusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are\nproxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes\nrather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the\nRefusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs\nrefuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation\nbetween refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically\nmeasurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently\nestimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.\nExtensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI\naccurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in\nfactual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and\nprovides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy\nand refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but\npreviously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high\naccuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and\nfragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy\nmetrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation."}

A natural next step is\nexperience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by\nadapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with\nSelf-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of\ngold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to\nspurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire\nanswer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency\nexamples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization\nmechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,\nenabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging\nreasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.\nWith Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to\n+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on\nGPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.\nThese results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward\nstronger reasoning without gold labels."}

Diagnosing Reasoning-Execution Gaps in VLM-Powered Mobile-Use Agents", "comment": null, "summary": "Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great\npotential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating\ncorresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies\nsuggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve\nthe execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution\naccuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth\nactions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,\nwhich in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may\nunknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss\nor trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to\ndiagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment\n(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the\nground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)\nmetric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.\nThis joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)\nExecution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action\nbut execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but\nreasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results\nacross a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution\ngaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than\nreasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,\nsizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis\nshows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in\nstate-of-the-art models.
