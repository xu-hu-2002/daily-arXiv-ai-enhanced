Our work addresses this gap by introducing\nStreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities\nunder real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations\nacross different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,\nQwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and\nMamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to\nprobe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs\ngenerally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in\ntasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the\ncorrect answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when\nsolving approximation tasks.

While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational\nconvergence can inadvertently cause \"cultural erasure\", the functional loss of\nproviding culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query\nlanguage. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing\na holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which\nquantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.\nUsing this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they\nconsistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural\nlocalization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the\ninternal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal\nfactual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at\ndifferent model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a\nnovel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying\ntargeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better\nbalance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the\nlimitations of current alignment techniques."}

We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation."}

Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training\nalgorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts\nduring training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different\nsizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization\ndatasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a\nmodel's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these\nvalues. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables\ncontrolled manipulation of values, we find that different preference\noptimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when\npreference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into\nhow values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,\nas well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization\nto improve model alignment to human values."}

To\naddress this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50\nproblems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International\nMathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original\nproblems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.\nMoreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a\nproof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental\nresults across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model\nachieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.\nBeyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising\nscaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results\nhighlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in\ncurrent LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into\nadvancing the reasoning abilities of language models.\nhttps://amo-bench.github.io/"}

Codebase-Level Understanding via Runtime Execution", "comment": null, "summary": "As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to\nautomatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We\npropose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,\nself-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.\nThe coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific\nentrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the\noutput of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only\nthe essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on\nGistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate\nmodeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially\nlarge code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models\nstruggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions\ntraces."}
