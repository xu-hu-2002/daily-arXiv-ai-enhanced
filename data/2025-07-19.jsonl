What permits us to draw in globally relevant\ninformation and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that\npeople use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to\nconstruct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a\ncomputational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''\n(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval\nand model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent\nworld models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel\nreasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of\nsports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning\nby requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;\n(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in\nlight of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA\napproach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,\nunder both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports\nmodel synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way\nthat mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over\nglobally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating\nhuman reasoning in open-ended domains."}

Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility", "comment": null, "summary": "Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question\nanswering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM\nmodal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with\nthe potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans."}

Using simple machine learning\nmethods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans-\nand isiXhosa-speaking children. Consistent with prior research, we identify\nlexical diversity (unique words) and length-based features (mean utterance\nlength) as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation\nrate prove less informative. Despite cross-linguistic variation in\npart-of-speech patterns, the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated\nwith goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of\nrequiring intervention. Our analysis of two linguistically distinct languages\nreveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency,\nwith implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts."}
