This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality."}

By automatically extracting logical patterns from\nstructured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,\nChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge\nclusters.

These conferences\noften rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and\ncollective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown\nsignificant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through\ncollaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,\nwe present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision\nconferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant\nagents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance\ndetection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and\nstance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,\nnegative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent\nsystem to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results\nindicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced\ndebates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also\nimprove the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and\ncoherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision\nconferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate\nthe potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group\ndecision-making processes.

In tax consulting\npractice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime\ncandidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of\ntax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and\nwell-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a\nconsiderable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for\nenhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and\nreal-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the\nbest configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to\nsupport tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial\nanalyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to\nthe sensitivity of the legal domain.

This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.\ndeleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has\nprimarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts\nproduced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only\nhas more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nsystems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first\ncomprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker\nattribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker\nattribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well\nas how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that\nattribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and\nthat the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated\nwith attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker\nattribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not\nbetter, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR\ntranscription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker\nidentity."}

The proposed KGA module augments the standard\nself-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward\naggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external\nknowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward\naggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations\nthrough KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying\nknowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles\nknowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds\nthem back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.\nBy synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports\nreal-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter\nmodification.
