Manuscript submitted for review to the Journal of\n  Computational Literary Studies (JCLS)", "summary": "This study positions large language models (LLMs) as \"subjective literary\ncritics\" to explore aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in literary\nassessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into\nEnglish and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent\nsessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed\nsignificant variations in evaluation consistency ({\\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to\n0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance\nacross stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming\ndistinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session\nwithin-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically\nminimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped\nby RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that\nLLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human\ncritical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers."}

Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal\nbehaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal\ndirection. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety\nmechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a\nseparate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially\nfinetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical\nsafety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as\nan intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing\nover-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent\nGuard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a\ndedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods.

The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit\nmanipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization\nframework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in\nextremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference\nthrough more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the\nquantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i)\ninitialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii)\nrefine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT\npost-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer\nquantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats.

Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of\nembedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language\nmodels (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI\n(small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media,\nscientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC).\nOur experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality\nsignificantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based\napproaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow\nalgorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived\nembeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in\ncross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid\nmodel evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical\napplications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes\nall embeddings from different models and code at\nhttps://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work\nprovides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly\ndetection systems."}

In the realm\nof Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like\nRegister-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,\ndespite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a\ndearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware\ndescription languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the\nperformance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization\nusing various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,\nan in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally\nequivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these\nmodels across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their\nsuitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose\nChain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of\nLLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves\ngenerating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem\nstatement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These\nsteps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or\ncode) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the\nstandard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This\nmethod not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization\nbut also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs\nfor VHDL."}

Recent advancements,\nhowever, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time\ninformation retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While\nprior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites,\ntheir capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains\nunexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic\nattributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic\ndataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international\nparticipants, we show that these models can access social media content and\npredict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic\ndataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles,\nwhich may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal\nactivity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science\nin the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information\noperations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards.

Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit\naddition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's\npredicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of\nwhether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight\nerror detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then\nextend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only\nGSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize\nwell to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal\nrepresentations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective\nre-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal\ndisruption to correct outputs.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative\ncapabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,\nand challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but\noften struggle with structured and semi-structured data.\n  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval\nstrategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by\nmetadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The\nframework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains\ntabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity.

We evaluate a range of monitoring\napproaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text\nclassifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple\nlinear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all\ntext-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or\nunsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers,\nwhile model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive\nsignal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning\ncompletes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT\nsegments.

In practice, these\ntargets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers\ndevelop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then\nrefine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make\nthis optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted\nranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on\nsimilarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a\nsample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by\nsimilarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these\nscores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over\n500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to\nthem. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation\nbenchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline\n(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks\nacross all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of\nbenchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms\nbaselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models\nrequire less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly\nmatching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities\nand highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale."}
