Departing from current transformer-based language models, which\noperate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which\nmeaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive\ntensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit\n\\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling\nirony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a\nsemantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical\ncomputation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward\nstability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,\ntensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a\nmodel of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,\nbut also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not\nfrom simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and\nthat this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one\ndesigned to shape language, not just predict it."}

To\naddress the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce\nan agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves\nmodel reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%.

This arises from their lack of macroscopic\nguidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as\ninsufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive\nto environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges,\nwe introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive\nglobal-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan\ndecomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and\nstep-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a\nmilestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience\nreuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution\nphase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to\ngenerate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone\nobjectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments\nacross two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially\noutperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary\nbenefits of its hierarchical components."}

Medical doctors guide these\nconversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the\ninformation required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent\ntrajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical\nIntelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with\nmedical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents\nbased on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We\nthen conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient\nturns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using\nProlific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an\nimportant resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the\nstate-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent\nclassification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general\nstructure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify\ntransitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common\ntrajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for\ndesigning `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the\nimpact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a\nsignificant boost in performance.

Teaching Extremely Low-Resource Languages to LLMs", "comment": "Accepted by EMNLP 2025", "summary": "Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts,\nas shown in Figure 1, remain largely unsupported by large language models\n(LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training\ndata. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can\nacquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without\nauxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20\nunder-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.\nOur findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script\nare extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with\nlanguage alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource\nlanguages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages\nrelatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on\nextremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our\nresults on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning\na multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts."}

This paper presents a hybrid, transparent\nframework for QDA that combines lexical and semantic methods to enable\ntriangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study\nin historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines\nusing NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over\npreprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation.

By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic\nclustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the\nlimitations of either method in isolation.

A Systematic Study of Knowledge Boundary Perception in LVLMs", "comment": "EMNLP2025 Findings", "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question\nanswering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model\nshould perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does\nnot. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by\nevaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer\nconsistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three\nLVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable\nperception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three\nconfidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable\nindicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To\nenhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration\nmethods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.\nAdditionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that\njointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering\nperformance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level\ncompared to LLMs."}

While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for\nassisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic\nbenchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches\nsystematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in\nthese tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of\nexisting benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a\nselective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation\nsurfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden\nwhen relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing\nframework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in\nscientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that\nyields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model\nparameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2)\nReasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context\non top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning\nimproves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm\nin which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces\n(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework\nleverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative\nrefinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic\nevaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares\ngenerative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,\ninteraction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and\nemotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces\nconsistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in\nover 70% of cases.
