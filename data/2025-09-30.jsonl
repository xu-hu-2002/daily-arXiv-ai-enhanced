In this work, we present an unsupervised approach that benchmarks models\non the basis of their uncertainty in classifying messages annotated by people\nbelonging to vulnerable groups. We use uncertainty, computed by means of the\nconformal prediction technique, as a proxy to analyze the bias of 11 models\nagainst women and non-white annotators and observe to what extent it diverges\nfrom metrics based on performance, such as the $F_1$ score.

Methods: Using GTP-4o three\nexperiments were completed. Accuracy was quantified by computing cosine\nsimilarity on TF-IDF vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and\nROUGE-1/ROUGE-L F1 between each response and its reference string or by manual\nevaluation by clinicians. Results: GPT-4o performed poorly on drug-formulation\nmatching, with frequent omissions of available drug formulations (mean 1.23 per\nmedication) and hallucinations of formulations that do not exist (mean 1.14 per\nmedication). Only 49% of tested medications were correctly matched to all\navailable formulations. Accuracy was decreased for medications with more\nformulations (p<0.0001). GPT-4o was also inconsistent at identifying\ndrug-drug-interactions, although it had better performance with the\nsearch-augmented assessment compared to its internal knowledge (54.7% vs.\n69.2%, p=0.013).

Addressing this, we propose GRACE, a\nframework that integrates two synergistic strategies: Gated Refinement and\nAdaptive Compression, achieving Efficient prompt optimization. The gated\nrefinement strategy introduces a feedback regulation gate and an update\nrejection gate, which refine update signals to produce stable and effective\nprompt improvements.

We address\nthis gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes\nmultimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are\ndistributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional\nmodalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient\nreasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts\nperformance. Moreover, reasoning degrades in three systematic ways: weaker\nmodalities drag down overall performance, conflicts bias preference toward\ncertain modalities, and joint signals from different modalities fail to be\nintegrated effectively. Therefore, we identify two core failures:\ntask-composition bottleneck, where recognition and reasoning cannot be jointly\nexecuted in one pass, and fusion bottleneck, where early integration introduces\nbias. For further investigation, we find that attention patterns fail to encode\nfact usefulness, but a simple two-step prompting (recognize then reason)\nrestores performance, confirming the task-composition bottleneck.

From a linguistic standpoint, this difficulty arises because LLMs\nare adept at capturing distributional semantics, which fundamentally differs\nfrom the morals which operate at the pragmatic level. This paper investigates\nhow LLMs can achieve generalized moral reasoning despite their reliance on\ndistributional semantics. We propose pragmatic inference methods grounded in\nmoral foundations theory, which leverage contextual information at each step to\nbridge the pragmatic gap and guide LLMs in connecting moral foundations with\nmoral reasoning objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly enhances LLMs' generalization in moral reasoning, providing a\nfoundation for future research grounded in moral foundations theory."}

However, prevailing prompt optimization methods, ranging\nfrom heuristic edits and reinforcement learning to evolutionary search,\nprimarily target point-wise accuracy. They seldom enforce paraphrase invariance\nor searching stability, and therefore cannot remedy this brittleness in\npractice. Automated prompt search remains brittle: small, semantically\npreserving paraphrases often cause large performance swings. We identify this\nbrittleness as the textual sharpness of the prompt landscape. In this work, we\nprovide the first formal treatment of textual sharpness in the discrete,\nsemantic space of prompts, together with an operational robustness criterion\nover a semantic neighborhood; the design is black-box or API-only, requiring no\ngradients to update the model's parameters.

We further propose ATARE, which learns anisotropic\nweights to shape the semantic neighborhood and adapts its radius over time to\nbalance exploration and fidelity.

Despite\nsignificant advances in aligning LLMs with safety and ethical standards,\nadversarial prompts can still be crafted to elicit undesirable responses.\nExisting mitigation strategies are predominantly based on post-hoc filtering,\nwhich introduces substantial latency or computational overhead, and is\nincompatible with token-level streaming generation. In this work, we introduce\nSelf-Sanitize, a novel LLM-driven mitigation framework inspired by cognitive\npsychology, which emulates human self-monitor and self-repair behaviors during\nconversations. Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that\ncontinuously inspects high-level intentions within the LLM at the token level\nvia representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place\ncorrection of harmful content without initiating separate review dialogues.\nThis design allows for real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair, with\nnegligible impact on latency and resource utilization. Given that\nprivacy-invasive content has often been insufficiently focused in previous\nstudies, we perform extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy\nleakage scenarios. The results demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior\nmitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading the utility\nof LLMs, offering a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments.\nOur code is available at the following link:\nhttps://github.com/wjfu99/LLM_Self_Sanitize"}

Built on\nDataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning\ndiverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic\ntasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with\nan average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming\nthe strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B\nalso performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also\nincorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the\nanalysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic\ntraining for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B\nfor the community's future research."}

To address these issues, we\npropose an efficient framework for LS systems that utilizes small LLMs\ndeployable in local environments. Within this framework, we explore knowledge\ndistillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines. Our\nexperiments in five languages evaluate model outputs both automatically and\nmanually. Our manual analysis reveals that while knowledge distillation boosts\nautomatic metric scores, it also introduces a safety trade-off by increasing\nharmful simplifications. Importantly, we find that the model's output\nprobability is a useful signal for detecting harmful simplifications.\nLeveraging this, we propose a filtering strategy that suppresses harmful\nsimplifications while largely preserving beneficial ones. This work establishes\na benchmark for efficient and safe LS with small LLMs. It highlights the key\ntrade-offs between performance, efficiency, and safety, and demonstrates a\npromising approach for safe real-world deployment."}

This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely\non costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses\nthis by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise\nintermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs\nfrom IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs,\nyielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five\nbenchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization\n(SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired\nsetting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained\nonly on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora\nand other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated\npairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of\ndirect synthesis.
