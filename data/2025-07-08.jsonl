A\nbenchmark dataset, comprising eight beam analysis problems, is created to test\nthe Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model.

This framework enables models to utilize\nAoT-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (AoT) prompts to automatically generate\nhigh-quality positive and negative reasoning paths, followed by self-alignment\nto enhance their reasoning abilities. Inspired by human strategies for solving\nproof-based problems, AoT uses answers as a guide to help the model extract\ncritical visual information that links questions and answers. When provided\nwith ground truth answers, the model produces strong positive rationales.\nConversely, when correct answers are replaced with misleading alternatives, the\nmodel generates an erroneous yet compelling reasoning path, serving as a form\nof discriminative negative rationale. Models trained with AoT-generated data\noutperform those trained on manually annotated datasets, demonstrating superior\nreasoning capabilities. This encourages the use of improved models to generate\nhigher-quality preference data for further optimization. Consequently, SMART\nestablishes an iterative generation-optimization method that continually\nenhances the model's reasoning skills. Experiments indicate that the SMART\nframework significantly improves various MLLMs, regardless of model\narchitecture, parameter size, or pre-training dataset. The code, datasets, and\nmodels will be released."}

Objective: To develop and evaluate a\nprivacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned\nLlama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical\ntranscriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the\nbrowser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical\ntranscription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the\nbase Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140\nmodified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics\n(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple\nclinical quality dimensions.

Recent studies have revealed the sink token,\nwhich receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic\nrole. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token\nand other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden\nstates, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,\nthe cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token\nand those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of\nthe sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens\nconsistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we\npropose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these\nfindings to select important tokens.

To this end, we introduce Edge ultra-lIte BERT\nframework (EI-BERT) with a novel cross-distillation method. EI-BERT efficiently\ncompresses models through a comprehensive pipeline including hard token\npruning, cross-distillation and parameter quantization. Specifically, the\ncross-distillation method uniquely positions the teacher model to understand\nthe student model's perspective, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer through\nparameter integration and the mutual interplay between models. Through\nextensive experiments, we achieve a remarkably compact BERT-based model of only\n1.91 MB - the smallest to date for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks.\nThis ultra-compact model has been successfully deployed across multiple\nscenarios within the Alipay ecosystem, demonstrating significant improvements\nin real-world applications.

This\nprogress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks\nfocus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and\ninteractive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap,\nwe introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated,\nmultimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically\nrenders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through\ntemporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then\nassessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a\nfine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring.\nWe construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30\nleading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking\nconsistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web\ndevelopment, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This\nestablishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the\nassessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a\nhigh-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often\noutperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the\nbenchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at\nhttps://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable\nand accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative\nmodels."}

While vector and graph\nembeddings represent data for similarity tasks, current state-of-the-art\npipelines lack guaranteed explainability, failing to determine similarity for\ngiven full texts accurately. These considerations can also be applied to\nclassifiers exploiting generative language models with logical prompts, which\nfail to correctly distinguish between logical implication, indifference, and\ninconsistency, despite being explicitly trained to recognise the first two\nclasses. We present a novel pipeline designed for hybrid explainability to\naddress this. Our methodology combines graphs and logic to produce First-Order\nLogic representations, creating machine- and human-readable representations\nthrough Montague Grammar. Preliminary results indicate the effectiveness of\nthis approach in accurately capturing full text similarity. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first approach to differentiate between implication,\ninconsistency, and indifference for text classification tasks. To address the\nlimitations of existing approaches, we use three self-contained datasets\nannotated for the former classification task to determine the suitability of\nthese approaches in capturing sentence structure equivalence, logical\nconnectives, and spatiotemporal reasoning.

Despite\nthe remarkable success of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), their\nperformance in text summarization across various domains and datasets has not\nbeen comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the ability to summarize text\neffectively without relying on extensive training data has become a crucial\nbottleneck. To address these issues, we present a systematic evaluation of six\nLLMs across four datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom (news), SAMSum (dialog),\nand ArXiv (scientific). By leveraging prompt engineering techniques including\nzero-shot and in-context learning, our study evaluates the performance using\nthe ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. In addition, a detailed analysis of inference\ntimes is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization\nquality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a\nsentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows\nto summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while\nLLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long\nscientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies.\nIn addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model\nparameters, dataset properties, and prompt design. These results offer\nactionable insights into how different LLMs behave across task types,\ncontributing to ongoing research in efficient, instruction-based NLP systems."}

Traditionally, estimating item\ndifficulties can be costly, requiring real students to respond to items,\nfollowed by fitting an item response theory (IRT) model to get item difficulty\nestimates. This approach cannot be applied to the cold-start setting for\npreviously unseen items either. In this work, we present SMART (Simulated\nStudents Aligned with IRT), a novel method for aligning simulated students with\ninstructed ability, which can then be used in simulations to predict the\ndifficulty of open-ended items. We achieve this alignment using direct\npreference optimization (DPO), where we form preference pairs based on how\nlikely responses are under a ground-truth IRT model. We perform a simulation by\ngenerating thousands of responses, evaluating them with an LLM-based scoring\nmodel, and fit the resulting data to an IRT model to obtain item difficulty\nestimates.
