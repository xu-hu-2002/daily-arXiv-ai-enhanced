Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good\nsentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve\ninternational issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional\nmethods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual\ncontent analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and\nlack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework\nthat identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift\npublic sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a\nlanguage model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this\nend, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and\ntheir associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories\nand in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual\nfeatures for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's\nnarrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual\ngeneration algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically\nproduce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this\nframework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with\na 70\\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for\ndiplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven\ninsights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a\nmore desirable public sentiment."}

We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and\nDeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the\ncombination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a\nrobust and effective solution for MPP."}

We propose five evaluation systems that have\nbeen tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from\nhigher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM\nevaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;\nReference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from\nthe original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the\nreference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive\nEvaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each\nquestion. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human\nevaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and\nscore Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the\nlowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square\ndeviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation\noffers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other\nmethods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results\nin concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to\ncorrectly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good\nresults due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that\nArtificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper\nmethodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic\nresources."}

When a homonym appears in a prompt,\ndiffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which\nis known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an\nAnglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the\ntext-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous\nin the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after\ntranslation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring\nduplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using\nboth automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human\nevaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym\nduplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach\nalso effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for\nthe automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available."}

But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and\nwhether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.\nFor instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the\nfinal answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,\nfor creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components\n(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity\nproduced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output\nhomogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.\nWe address this gap in the literature directly by making the following\ncontributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task\ncategories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.\n(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output\nhomogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that\nincreases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is\nundesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We\nchallenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by\nincreasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we\ndemonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of\noutput homogenization."}

However, progress is\nlimited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are\noften generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to\naddress the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.\nCrucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the\ncharacter-level annotations required for the precise localization of\nAI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce\nLLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for\nAI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern\nproprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key\ntasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel\ntask of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level\nannotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training\nand evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection\nmodels.

Although many methods aim to\nmitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how\nthese perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.\nThis gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate\nduring the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt\noptimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the\neffect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first\nderive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the\noutput fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:\n(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning\nsteps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot\neliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to\nthe Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified\nversion of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound\nfor input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input\nembedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we\nconduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.\nThe experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically\ndemonstrating the correctness of our findings."}

We introduce\nDisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer\nwith a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic\nstructure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to\nyield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's\ngrammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are\nfactorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of\nmillions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised\ncontrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and\nword order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,\nboosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves\n93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark.

Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its\neffectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.\nWe investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized\ndatasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that\nprompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation\nin language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant\ntop-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource\nlanguages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale\nsynthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13\nIndian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an\nemphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian\ncultural contexts.
