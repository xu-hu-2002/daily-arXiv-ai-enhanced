The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and\nexclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We\napply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from\n1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across\nmultiple linguistic dimensions.

This tendency is reinforced\nby preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction\nbut can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,\nsycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific\nquestion answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,\ndecision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this\nphenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by\nintroducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of\nsycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much\nuser-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates\nadversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading\nresistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to\nmaintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations\nacross open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic\ntendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate\nthis issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that\nfine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with\nchain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while\nreinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA\nbenchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance\nwithout compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a\npractical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior."}

Practical applications have driven the development of various\nautomatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with\nhuman-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.\nOver time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic\nsimilarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators.

This\npaper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the\nmethodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,\nvalidation methods, and correlations with human judgment.
