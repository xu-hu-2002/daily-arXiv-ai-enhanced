Considering the impressive\nperformance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive\nplanning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective\ngoal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented\nconversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to\ndialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate\ninformation in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part\ninformational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating\nintermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational\ncomponents corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible\nconfigurations for these informational components lead to limited information\nstates. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information\nstates and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created.\nEventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is\nimplemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model, database\nqueries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of\nretrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables\npassing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of\ncongruency. Evaluations exploiting the complete test conversations of MultiWOZ,\nwith no more than a domain in a conversation, illustrate maximal inform and\nsuccess, and improvement compared with previous methods."}

Across two types of LLMs, we investigate whether supervised finetuning\ncan improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such\nimprovements generalize across tasks and domains. We finetune the LLMs on\ndatasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and\nevaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation,\nwhere the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise\nconfidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more\nlikely to have correct. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including\nmedical and legal reasoning. Results show that finetuning improves calibration\n(alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher\nconfidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains,\nwhile leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific:\ntraining on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise\ncomparison, and vice versa. In contrast, multitask finetuning on both forms of\nmetacognition yields broader gains, producing lower calibration error and\nstronger discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations.

Their\ndistinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong\nperformance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show\nthat the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also\ncan be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this\nproblem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including\ndistinguishing between different models as well as between different\ncheckpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we\nidentify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the\ndecoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that\nrelying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is\nmainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded\ntoken influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model\nconfidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding\ndecoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel\ninformation extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which\ncaptures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals\nmodel-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted\nstructural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory\nAttribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each\ndecoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a\ntrajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher\nlog-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to\nhave been generated by that model.

By explicitly\nscaffolding the reasoning process through controlled code-switching, CSICL acts\nas an implicit linguistic bridge that enhances cross-lingual alignment and\nreduces reliance on the translation barrier. We conduct extensive experiments\nacross 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, spanning both knowledge-intensive\nand reasoning-oriented domains. Our results demonstrate that CSICL consistently\noutperforms X-ICL baselines, achieving gains of 3.1%p and 1.9%p in both target\nand unseen languages, respectively. The improvement is even more pronounced in\nlow-resource settings, with gains of 14.7% in target and 5.3% in unseen\nlanguages. These findings establish code-switching as a principled and robust\napproach for overcoming the translation barrier during inference, moving LLMs\ntoward more equitable and effective multilingual systems."}

In this\nwork, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings;\nas the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism\nbecomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions.
