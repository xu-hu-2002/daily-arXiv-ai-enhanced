However, creating open-ended study or\nexamination questions and grading their answers is still a tedious task. This\nthesis presents the foundation for a system that generates questions grounded\nin class materials and automatically grades student answers. It introduces a\nsophisticated method for chunking documents with a visual layout, specifically\ntargeting PDF documents. This method enhances the accuracy of downstream tasks,\nincluding Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Our thesis demonstrates that\nhigh-quality questions and reference answers can be generated from study\nmaterial. Further, it introduces a new benchmark for automated grading of short\nanswers to facilitate comparison of automated grading systems. An evaluation of\nvarious grading systems is conducted and indicates that Large Language Models\n(LLMs) can generalise to the task of automated grading of short answers from\ntheir pre-training tasks. As with other tasks, increasing the parameter size of\nthe LLMs leads to greater performance. Currently, available systems still need\nhuman oversight, especially in examination scenarios."}

It contains simulated generated conversations between a chatbot\nand a (simulated) user, where the chatbot is explicitly asked to showcase\nmanipulation tactics, persuade the user towards some goal, or simply be\nhelpful. We consider a diverse set of chatbot manipulation contexts, from\nconsumer and personal advice to citizen advice and controversial proposition\nargumentation. Each conversation is annotated by human annotators for both\ngeneral manipulation and specific manipulation tactics. Our research reveals\nthree key findings. First, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be manipulative\nwhen explicitly instructed, with annotators identifying manipulation in\napproximately 84\\% of such conversations. Second, even when only instructed to\nbe ``persuasive'' without explicit manipulation prompts, LLMs frequently\ndefault to controversial manipulative strategies, particularly gaslighting and\nfear enhancement. Third, small fine-tuned open source models, such as\nBERT+BiLSTM have a performance comparable to zero-shot classification with\nlarger models like Gemini 2.5 pro in detecting manipulation, but are not yet\nreliable for real-world oversight.

Current approaches struggle in this regard, as they\nrequire fixed, well-defined modelling environments, and they cannot adapt to\nnovel variables without re-designs, or incorporate new information without\nre-training. To address this, we frame digital twinning as an in-context\nlearning problem using large language models, enabling seamless updates to the\ntwin at inference time.

These speculations were largely\nsettled by the demonstration from DeepSeek-R1 that chains-of-thought and\nreinforcement learning (RL) can effectively replicate reasoning on top of base\nLLMs. However, it remains valuable to explore alternative methods for\ntheoretically eliciting reasoning that could help elucidate the underlying\nmechanisms, as well as providing additional methods that may offer\ncomplementary benefits.\n  Here, we build on the long-standing literature in cognitive psychology and\ncognitive architectures, which postulates that reasoning arises from the\norchestrated, sequential execution of a set of modular, predetermined cognitive\noperations. Crucially, we implement this key idea within a modern agentic\ntool-calling framework.

To address this, we propose Direct Reasoning Optimization\n(DRO), a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning LLMs on open-ended,\nparticularly long-form, reasoning tasks, guided by a new reward signal: the\nReasoning Reflection Reward (R3). At its core, R3 selectively identifies and\nemphasizes key tokens in the reference outcome that reflect the influence of\nthe model's preceding chain-of-thought reasoning, thereby capturing the\nconsistency between reasoning and reference outcome at a fine-grained level.\nCrucially, R3 is computed internally using the same model being optimized,\nenabling a fully self-contained training setup.

Repeating a\nnew word, such as from a new language, can be a challenging task also for\nadults. Additionally, brain damage, such as from a stroke, may lead to\nsystematic speech errors with specific characteristics dependent on the\nlocation of the brain damage. Cognitive sciences suggest a model with various\ncomponents for the different processing stages involved in word repetition.\nWhile some studies have begun to localize the corresponding regions in the\nbrain, the neural mechanisms and how exactly the brain performs word repetition\nremain largely unknown. We propose to bridge the gap between the cognitive\nmodel of word repetition and neural mechanisms in the human brain by modeling\nthe task using deep neural networks. Neural models are fully observable,\nallowing us to study the detailed mechanisms in their various substructures and\nmake comparisons with human behavior and, ultimately, the brain. Here, we make\nfirst steps in this direction by: (1) training a large set of models to\nsimulate the word repetition task; (2) creating a battery of tests to probe the\nmodels for known effects from behavioral studies in humans, and (3) simulating\nbrain damage through ablation studies, where we systematically remove neurons\nfrom the model, and repeat the behavioral study to examine the resulting speech\nerrors in the \"patient\" model.

MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention\nmechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model,\nwhich contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters\nactivated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1\nmillion tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning\nattention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time\ncompute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that\nrequire processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained\nusing large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including\nsandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to\nM1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel\nRL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling\nweights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants.\nCombining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on\n512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just\n$534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K\nthinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate\nphase of the 80K training.
