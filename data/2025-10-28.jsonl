Current state-of-the-art pipelines enforce a\nstrict think-then-answer format to elicit chain-of-thought (CoT); however, the\nbehavior of PO when these rigid constraints are relaxed into an open-ended CoT\nstructure remains an under-studied question. We investigate this gap with an\nextensive suite of controlled experiments and identify a consistent principle:\n\\textit{policy optimization consistently follows the path of least resistance}.\nWhen afforded the flexibility to interleave reasoning and response, policy\noptimization consistently learns to discard explicit reasoning, causing the\npolicy to degenerate to a direct \\texttt{<answer>}-only format. This outcome\nholds true across various models and algorithms. We find that this collapse in\nformat is persistent even when the complex \\texttt{<think><answer>} format is\nassigned up to 4x larger reward weights. We formalize this principle through a\nseries of controlled reward decomposition experiments, demonstrating a clear\nhierarchy: PO systematically optimizes for the simplest reward component first,\na preference that holds even when faced with mutually exclusive choices or\nstrong incentives for more complex behaviors. Finally, we show that successful\nconvergence on the high-reward shortcut is not a low-effort drift but is driven\nby the optimization process that requires the KL-regularized policy to have\nsufficient freedom to make a significant shift from its initial prior. Our\nfindings reveal that granting policies the freedom to diverge is a double-edged\nsword: while necessary for discovering high-reward shortcuts, it also creates a\npowerful incentive to game the simplest aspects of the reward function, posing\na critical challenge for reward hacking under alignment."}

We introduce Infinity-Chat, a large-scale dataset of 26K diverse,\nreal-world, open-ended user queries that admit a wide range of plausible\nanswers with no single ground truth. We introduce the first comprehensive\ntaxonomy for characterizing the full spectrum of open-ended prompts posed to\nLMs, comprising 6 top-level categories (e.g., brainstorm & ideation) that\nfurther breaks down to 17 subcategories. Using Infinity-Chat, we present a\nlarge-scale study of mode collapse in LMs, revealing a pronounced Artificial\nHivemind effect in open-ended generation of LMs, characterized by (1)\nintra-model repetition, where a single model consistently generates similar\nresponses, and more so (2) inter-model homogeneity, where different models\nproduce strikingly similar outputs.

The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep\nstructural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.\nTo enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage\nRefinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative\ngeneration from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline\ninto rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a\nprofessionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to\nspecialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in\nimplementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data.

However,\nto the best of our knowledge, there are limited datasets specifically designed\nfor drug drug relation extraction currently available.

Our PRM predicts the factual correctness of each generated sentence,\nconditioned on clinical context and preceding text.

We further show its practical utility: PRM scores effectively\nfilter low-quality reports, improving F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% (when\ndiscarding the worst 10% of reports). Moreover, when guiding a novel weighted\nbest-of-N selection process on the MIMIC-CXR test set, our PRM show relative\nimprovements in clinical metrics of 7.4% for F1-CheXbert and 0.6% for\nBERTScore.

However, existing\nbenchmarks evaluate only response quality or retrieval performance without\ndirectly measuring intent identification capabilities. This gap is critical\nbecause without understanding which intents users prioritize, systems cannot\ngenerate responses satisfying individual information needs. To address this, we\nintroduce the concept of core intents: intents users prioritize when selecting\nanswers to satisfy their information needs. To evaluate these core intents, we\npropose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized\nQuestion Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized\nintents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer\nselection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting\ntheir acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains\nthrough systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality\ncontrol combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental\nevaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems\nstruggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts. Models fail\nto identify core intents from user histories, with performance degrading as\nquestion complexity increases. The code and dataset will be made publicly\navailable to facilitate future research in this direction."}

In this\nwork, we demonstrate that modern LLMs can be effectively adapted using only\nminimal, high-quality supervision. To enable this, we design\nLIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, a reusable and open-source pipeline for generating\ndiverse, challenging, and realistic reranking examples. Using this synthetic\ndata, we fine-tune our reranker model, LIMRANK. We evaluate LIMRANK on two\nchallenging benchmarks, i.e., BRIGHT for reasoning-intensive retrieval and\nFollowIR for instruction-following retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that\nLIMRANK achieves competitive performance, while being trained on less than 5%\nof the data typically used in prior work. Further ablation studies demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and the strong generalization\ncapabilities of LIMRANK across downstream tasks, including scientific\nliterature search and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive\nproblem solving."}

This proposal evaluates traditional\nmachine learning models and fine-tuned transformers for a previously split hope\nspeech dataset as train, development and test set. On development test, a\nlinear-kernel SVM and logistic regression both reached a macro-F1 of 0.78; SVM\nwith RBF kernel reached 0.77, and Na\\\"ive Bayes hit 0.75. Transformer models\ndelivered better results, the best model achieved weighted precision of 0.82,\nweighted recall of 0.80, weighted F1 of 0.79, macro F1 of 0.79, and 0.80\naccuracy. These results suggest that while optimally configured traditional\nmachine learning models remain agile, transformer architectures detect some\nsubtle semantics of hope to achieve higher precision and recall in hope speech\ndetection, suggesting that larges transformers and LLMs could perform better in\nsmall datasets."}

In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many\nquality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces\njudgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding\ndiluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a\ntwo-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1\nperforms adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical\ndimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise,\nevidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a\ntargeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters\nmost. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn\ntraces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making\nthe approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting\nall-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning,\nBR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet\nconsequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nthree challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code\nand the model will be released soon."}
