For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with\nobjective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other\nlanguage features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,\nconcreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to\nwhich we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.\nThose features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,\nconducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands\nof words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human\nratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover\nmany different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we\nevaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on\ntwo psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets\ncover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that\nalignment is \\textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated\n(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and\ngender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,\nolfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation\nof current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which\nmay be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and\nillustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets."}

Specialized agents, each\nresponsible for discrete review criteria such as template compliance or factual\ncorrectness, operate in parallel or sequence as required. Evaluation outputs\nare enforced to a standardized, machine-readable schema, supporting downstream\nanalytics and auditability. Continuous monitoring and a feedback loop with\nhuman reviewers allow for iterative system improvement and bias mitigation.\n  Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the AI Agent-as-Judge system\napproaches or exceeds human performance in key areas: achieving 99% information\nconsistency (vs. 92% for humans), halving error and bias rates, and reducing\naverage review time from 30 to 2.5 minutes per document, with a 95% agreement\nrate between AI and expert human judgment.

A\ndrafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language\nmodels, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree\nconsisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target\nmodel, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered\nthat the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies\nof the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the\nvocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We\nfirst identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an\nunnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs\nwith very large vocabularies.

To address this issue, we adapt suitable formats to\nthe given tasks by generating and selecting formats. We first propose how to\nmeasure the reasoning error when generating multiple answers. Then, we\nintroduce Format-Adapter, which utilizes LLMs to generate and select suitable\nreasoning formats by minimizing the error measurement we present.

At its core is a hierarchical\nHopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic\ntokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or\nsupervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences\nas multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind\nco-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an\nemergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into\nlong-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter\nnatural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with\ncoherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.\nLanguage is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints\ndictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in\nalignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form\nof plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to\ngeneralize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We\ndemonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds\ndistributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding.

In this paper, we introduce jigsaw\npuzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and\nsystematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on an open-source multimodal\nmodel, Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid\ntask acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more\nslowly on novel tasks but maintains prior knowledge. We analyze this phenomenon\nthrough the lens of learning dynamics, showing that RFT reinforces correct\nsamples that are naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape,\nmitigating interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, supervised training on\ncorrect RFT-simulated rollouts allows SFT to preserve knowledge while rapidly\nlearning new tasks. These findings suggest that data distribution, rather than\nalgorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight\nRFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language\nmodels."}

To arrive at\nthis, I present several contributions in three areas of natural language\nprocessing and machine learning: automatic fact checking, learning with limited\ndata, and scientific text processing. These contributions include new methods\nand resources for identifying check-worthy claims, adversarial claim\ngeneration, multi-source domain adaptation, learning from crowd-sourced labels,\ncite-worthiness detection, zero-shot scientific fact checking, detecting\nexaggerated scientific claims, and modeling degrees of information change in\nscience communication. Critically, I demonstrate how the research outputs of\nthis thesis are useful for effectively learning from limited amounts of\nscientific text in order to identify misinformative scientific statements and\ngenerate new insights into the science communication process"}

While unstructured narratives\noffer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic\nanalysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully\nautomated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on\nclinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full\ntranscript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where\nspecialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with\nhuman analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate\nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable,\npatient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be\nfine-tuned for specific clinical contexts."}

A Scoping Review from a Mathematics Education Perspective", "comment": null, "summary": "The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question\nof how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support\nmathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle\ntextual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word\nproblems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the\nreal-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We\nconducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including\nthree parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in\nresearch, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical\nword problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the\nconceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs\nand students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled\nmathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics\neducation. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most\npopular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require\na consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our\nevaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems\nshows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,\nincluding a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed\nweaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or\nnon-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have\nmastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,\nwhich potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics\nclassrooms."}

In this\npaper, we propose EXPERT, a reference-free evaluation metric that provides\nstructured explanations based on three fundamental criteria: fluency,\nrelevance, and descriptiveness. By constructing large-scale datasets of\nhigh-quality structured explanations, we develop a two-stage evaluation\ntemplate to effectively supervise a vision-language model for both scoring and\nexplanation generation. EXPERT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark\ndatasets while providing significantly higher-quality explanations than\nexisting metrics, as validated through comprehensive human evaluation.

Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus\nmodel using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including\nGoogle DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the\nsecurity of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or\nattacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an\nopen-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted\ninput and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard\nmodel ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack\nsuccess rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second,\nwe introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on\nClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier\npipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33%\nASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no\naccess to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations\nthat developers could use to thwart staged attacks."}

Concretely, we\nfind that representation dispersion - the average pairwise cosine distance\namong hidden vectors - strongly and negatively correlates with perplexity\nacross diverse model families (LLaMA, Qwen, and others) and domains (Wikipedia,\nnews, scientific abstracts). Beyond illustrating this link, we show how\ndispersion can be leveraged for a range of practical tasks without requiring\nlabeled data. First, measuring dispersion on unlabeled text allows us to\npredict downstream accuracy in new domains, offering a data-efficient tool for\nmodel selection. Next, we find that identifying layers with higher dispersion\npinpoints the best representations for retrieval-based methods such as kNN-LM,\nbypassing exhaustive layer-by-layer searches. Finally, we integrate a simple\npush-away objective into training, which increases dispersion in both\nsingle-domain and cross-domain scenarios and directly improves perplexity in\neach."}

Traditional methods rely\non manual comparison, which is labor-intensive and prone to human error. This\nstudy evaluates the potential of pre-trained transformer-based language models,\nincluding E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, and LaBSE, for detecting textual parallels in\nthe Hebrew Bible. Focusing on known parallels between the books of Samuel/Kings\nand Chronicles, I assessed each model's capability to generate word embeddings\nthat delineate parallel from non-parallel passages. Utilizing cosine similarity\nand Wasserstein Distance measures, I found that E5 and AlephBERT show\nsignificant promise, with E5 excelling in parallel detection and AlephBERT\ndemonstrating stronger non-parallel differentiation. These findings indicate\nthat pre-trained models can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of detecting\nintertextual parallels in ancient texts, suggesting broader applications for\nancient language studies."}
