To address these limitations, we propose a\nunified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety\nbehaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and\nrejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,\neach behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,\nor magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at\ninference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as\npositive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and\nrejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.\nThis co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the\noutput space, characterized by well-separated response distributions\ncorresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides\nempirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented\nfine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety\nalignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1\n(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training\ncomplexity and deployment costs.

We conduct a controlled study that scales the\nlanguage model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and\noptimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,\nformalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce\nthis complexity.
