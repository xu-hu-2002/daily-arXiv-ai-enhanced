However, in tasks such\nas text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective\ndomain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of\ninput pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the\nrich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge\ndistillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the\narchitectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by\nreinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder\ngenerates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output\nspace. During training, the encoder produces representations and their\nsimilarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the\nteacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.\nThe MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and\nadaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative\nsamples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing\nthe LLM to achieve improved performance. Experiments on financial and\nhealthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm its\neffectiveness, and the model has been fully deployed in an online environment."}

This paper introduces RabakBench, a new multilingual safety\nbenchmark localized to Singapore's unique linguistic context, covering\nSinglish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. RabakBench is constructed through a\nscalable three-stage pipeline: (i) Generate - adversarial example generation by\naugmenting real Singlish web content with LLM-driven red teaming; (ii) Label -\nsemi-automated multi-label safety annotation using majority-voted LLM labelers\naligned with human judgments; and (iii) Translate - high-fidelity translation\npreserving linguistic nuance and toxicity across languages. The final dataset\ncomprises over 5,000 safety-labeled examples across four languages and six\nfine-grained safety categories with severity levels. Evaluations of 11 popular\nopen-source and closed-source guardrail classifiers reveal significant\nperformance degradation. RabakBench not only enables robust safety evaluation\nin Southeast Asian multilingual settings but also offers a reproducible\nframework for building localized safety datasets in low-resource environments.\nThe benchmark dataset, including the human-verified translations, and\nevaluation code are publicly available."}

However, it still\nfaces challenges such as high carbon emissions during data augmentation and the\nrisk of data leakage when we use closed-source LLMs. To address these issues,\nwe propose a self-evolution method for language models. First, we introduce the\nMulti-level Principle Generation, which enables a large-scale model to\nsummarize task-completion principles based on a small amount of task data.\nThen, we propose the Principle-based Instance Generation, in which a\nsmaller-scale language model uses these task principles to generate a large\namount of data. This data is then used for model training. Experimental results\nshow that our proposed method significantly improves model performance compared\nto directly using a smaller-scale language model to generate data.\nAdditionally, since we only use the large-scale language model to generate the\ntask-completion principles, the carbon emissions associated with training the\nmodel are greatly reduced."}
