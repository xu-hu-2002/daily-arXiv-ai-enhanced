We present MALIBU, a novel benchmark developed to assess the\ndegree to which LLM-based multi-agent systems implicitly reinforce social\nbiases and stereotypes. MALIBU evaluates bias in LLM-based multi-agent systems\nthrough scenario-based assessments. AI models complete tasks within predefined\ncontexts, and their responses undergo evaluation by an LLM-based multi-agent\njudging system in two phases. In the first phase, judges score responses\nlabeled with specific demographic personas (e.g., gender, race, religion)\nacross four metrics. In the second phase, judges compare paired responses\nassigned to different personas, scoring them and selecting the superior\nresponse.

Further, we find that selecting difficult examples that\nrequire more diverse reasoning strategies is more sample-efficient to transfer\nthe teacher model's reasoning skills. Evaluated on both Llama and Qwen models,\ntraining with NaturalThoughts outperforms existing reasoning datasets such as\nOpenThoughts, LIMO, etc. on general STEM reasoning benchmarks including\nGPQA-Diamond, MMLU-Pro and SuperGPQA."}

Using market digest texts--including objective morning\nsummaries and subjective closing-bell analyses--as test cases, we assess\ndecision quality based on the financial performance of trades executed by human\ninvestors and autonomous LLM agents informed exclusively by these texts. Our\nfindings reveal that neither humans nor LLM agents consistently surpass random\nperformance when relying solely on summaries. However, richer analytical\ncommentaries enable collaborative human-LLM teams to outperform individual\nhuman or agent baselines significantly. Our approach underscores the importance\nof evaluating generated text by its ability to facilitate synergistic\ndecision-making between humans and LLMs, highlighting critical limitations of\ntraditional intrinsic metrics."}

This\nstudy investigates the performances of two state-of-the-art Automatic Speech\nRecognition (ASR) models, OpenAI's Whisper (Small & Large-V2) and Facebook's\nWav2Vec-BERT on Bangla, a low-resource language. We have conducted experiments\nusing two publicly available datasets: Mozilla Common Voice-17 and OpenSLR to\nevaluate model performances. Through systematic fine-tuning and hyperparameter\noptimization, including learning rate, epochs, and model checkpoint selection,\nwe have compared the models based on Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error\nRate (CER), Training Time, and Computational Efficiency. The Wav2Vec-BERT model\noutperformed Whisper across all key evaluation metrics, demonstrated superior\nperformance while requiring fewer computational resources, and offered valuable\ninsights to develop robust speech recognition systems in low-resource\nlinguistic settings."}

They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators\nin sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This,\nalong with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a\ncloser examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we\nbegin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet\nmost complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability\nrelates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their\ncomprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that\nLLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the\nbeliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or\nsuspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the\narguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures\nof dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings\ntie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand\nthe context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that,\nif an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to\nknow what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and\ncoherence are secondary to effectiveness."}
