This question is central to the ability of LLMs in inductive\nreasoning. Existing research on LLM-based inductive reasoning can be broadly\ncategorized based on whether the underlying rules are expressible via explicit\nmathematical equations. However, many recent studies in the beyond-equations\ncategory have emphasized rule design without grounding them in specific\nscenarios. Inspired by the parallels between inductive reasoning and human\nscientific discovery, we propose the task of LLM-Based Scientific Inductive\nReasoning Beyond Equations and introduce a new benchmark, SIRBench-V1, to\nevaluate the inductive reasoning abilities of LLMs in scientific settings. Our\nexperimental results show that current LLMs still struggle with this task,\nunderscoring its difficulty and the need for further advancement in this area."}

Studies have attempted\nto assess the psychometric properties of LLMs by borrowing concepts from human\npsychology to enhance their interpretability, but they fail to account for the\nfundamental differences between LLMs and humans. This results in high rejection\nrates when human scales are reused directly. Furthermore, these scales do not\nsupport the measurement of LLM psychological property variations in different\nlanguages. This paper introduces AIPsychoBench, a specialized benchmark\ntailored to assess the psychological properties of LLM. It uses a lightweight\nrole-playing prompt to bypass LLM alignment, improving the average effective\nresponse rate from 70.12% to 90.40%. Meanwhile, the average biases are only\n3.3% (positive) and 2.1% (negative), which are significantly lower than the\nbiases of 9.8% and 6.9%, respectively, caused by traditional jailbreak prompts.\nFurthermore, among the total of 112 psychometric subcategories, the score\ndeviations for seven languages compared to English ranged from 5% to 20.2% in\n43 subcategories, providing the first comprehensive evidence of the linguistic\nimpact on the psychometrics of LLM."}

However, prior research has primarily focused on monolingual\nsettings-mostly in English-leaving the potential benefits of multilingual AR\nmodels underexplored. We introduce a novel method for multilingual AR learning\nthat incorporates two key innovations: probabilistic content masking, which\nencourages the model to focus on stylistically indicative words rather than\ncontent-specific words, and language-aware batching, which improves contrastive\nlearning by reducing cross-lingual interference. Our model is trained on over\n4.5 million authors across 36 languages and 13 domains. It consistently\noutperforms monolingual baselines in 21 out of 22 non-English languages,\nachieving an average Recall@8 improvement of 4.85%, with a maximum gain of\n15.91% in a single language.

We empirically tested these\ncontrasting scenarios by varying key interaction patterns. We find that\nstate-of-the-art models: (1) are more likely to endorse a user's\ncounterargument when framed as a follow-up from a user, rather than when both\nresponses are presented simultaneously for evaluation; (2) show increased\nsusceptibility to persuasion when the user's rebuttal includes detailed\nreasoning, even when the conclusion of the reasoning is incorrect; and (3) are\nmore readily swayed by casually phrased feedback than by formal critiques, even\nwhen the casual input lacks justification.

Next, we collate existing datasets and evaluation\nbenchmarks currently used for RL fine-tuning, spanning human-annotated\ndatasets, AI-assisted preference data, and program-verification-style corpora.\nSubsequently, we review the mainstream open-source tools and training\nframeworks available, providing clear practical references for subsequent\nresearch. Finally, we analyse the future challenges and trends in the field of\nRL-enhanced LLMs. This survey aims to present researchers and practitioners\nwith the latest developments and frontier trends at the intersection of RL and\nLLMs, with the goal of fostering the evolution of LLMs that are more\nintelligent, generalizable, and secure."}

While Multi-Head Attention (MHA) offers strong\nrepresentational power, it incurs significant memory overhead.

While MLA already achieves\nsignificant KV cache reduction, the scope for further compression remains\nlimited without performance loss. In this paper, we propose\n\\textbf{Embedding-Gated Multi-head Latent Attention (EG-MLA)}, a novel\nextension of MLA that further reduces KV cache size while enhancing\nrepresentational expressiveness. EG-MLA introduces a token-specific embedding\ngating mechanism applied in the latent space, enabling fine-grained modulation\nof compressed KV vectors with minimal additional computation. Compared to MHA,\nEG-MLA achieves over 91.6\\% reduction in KV cache size with negligible\nperformance degradation. Relative to MLA, EG-MLA consistently improves task\naccuracy across diverse reasoning benchmarks while achieving up to 59.9\\%\nadditional memory savings. Our theoretical analysis highlights how embedding\ngating induces implicit high-order interactions, and empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate robust generalization across model scales and compression regimes.\nNotably, we successfully scale EG-MLA to over 1 billion parameters,\ndemonstrating its practical viability for large-scale LLM deployment.

Yet existing methods face two major limitations: (i)\nevicting entries after full-context prefill causes unbounded peak memory, and\n(ii) query-dependent eviction narrows the cache to a single query, leading to\ndegraded accuracy in multi-turn conversations. We introduce EpiCache, a\ntraining-free KV cache management framework for long conversational question\nanswering (LongConvQA) under fixed memory budgets. EpiCache bounds cache growth\nthrough block-wise prefill and preserves topic-relevant context via episodic KV\ncompression, which clusters conversation history into coherent episodes and\napplies episode-specific KV cache eviction. We further design an adaptive\nlayer-wise budget allocation strategy that measures each layer's sensitivity to\neviction and distributes the memory budget across layers accordingly.

We propose In-Context Representation Learning (ICRL) as a\nproof-of-concept to allow LLMs to adaptively utilize non-text modality\nrepresentations with few-shot learning. Unlike traditional in-context learning,\nwhich incorporates text-label pairs, ICRL replaces text inputs with FM\nrepresentations, enabling the LLM to perform multi-modal inference without\nfine-tuning. We evaluate ICRL on a suite of tasks in the molecular domain,\ninvestigating three core research questions: (i) how to map FM representations\ninto LLMs in a training-free manner, (ii) what factors influence ICRL\nperformance, and (iii) what mechanisms underlie the effectiveness of ICRL. To\nthe best of our knowledge, ICRL is the first training-free framework for\nintegrating non-text modality representations into text-based LLMs, presenting\na promising direction for adaptable, multi-modal generalization."}

These findings uncover fundamental limitations in interpreting\ncross-attention as an explanatory proxy, suggesting that it offers an\ninformative yet incomplete view of the factors driving predictions in S2T\nmodels."}

RadEval consolidates a diverse range of metrics, from classic\nn-gram overlap (BLEU, ROUGE) and contextual measures (BERTScore) to clinical\nconcept-based scores (F1CheXbert, F1RadGraph, RaTEScore, SRR-BERT,\nTemporalEntityF1) and advanced LLM-based evaluators (GREEN). We refine and\nstandardize implementations, extend GREEN to support multiple imaging\nmodalities with a more lightweight model, and pretrain a domain-specific\nradiology encoder, demonstrating strong zero-shot retrieval performance. We\nalso release a richly annotated expert dataset with over 450 clinically\nsignificant error labels and show how different metrics correlate with\nradiologist judgment. Finally, RadEval provides statistical testing tools and\nbaseline model evaluations across multiple publicly available datasets,\nfacilitating reproducibility and robust benchmarking in radiology report\ngeneration."}

However, we find that many recent studies adopt experimental designs\nthat systematically undermine the validity of their claims. From a survey of\nover 40 papers, we identify six recurring methodological flaws: agents are\noften homogeneous (Profile), interactions are absent or artificially imposed\n(Interaction), memory is discarded (Memory), prompts tightly control outcomes\n(Minimal-Control), agents can infer the experimental hypothesis (Unawareness),\nand validation relies on simplified theoretical models rather than real-world\ndata (Realism). For instance, GPT-4o and Qwen-3 correctly infer the underlying\nsocial experiment in 53.1% of cases when given instructions from prior\nwork-violating the Unawareness principle. We formalize these six requirements\nas the PIMMUR principles and argue they are necessary conditions for credible\nLLM-based social simulation. To demonstrate their impact, we re-run five\nrepresentative studies using a framework that enforces PIMMUR and find that the\nreported social phenomena frequently fail to emerge under more rigorous\nconditions. Our work establishes methodological standards for LLM-based\nmulti-agent research and provides a foundation for more reliable and\nreproducible claims about \"AI societies.\""}

Our method features a\ndialect fusion module and a Dialect-Specialized Dynamic Routing Network\n(DSDR-Net) to capture fine-grained acoustic and linguistic variations across\ndialects.
