However, most existing graph document representations rely on\nheuristics, domain-specific rules, or expert knowledge. Unlike previous\napproaches, we propose a method to learn data-driven graph structures,\neliminating the need for manual design and reducing domain dependence. Our\napproach constructs homogeneous weighted graphs with sentences as nodes, while\nedges are learned via a self-attention model that identifies dependencies\nbetween sentence pairs. A statistical filtering strategy aims to retain only\nstrongly correlated sentences, improving graph quality while reducing the graph\nsize. Experiments on three document classification datasets demonstrate that\nlearned graphs consistently outperform heuristic-based graphs, achieving higher\naccuracy and $F_1$ score. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the effectiveness\nof the statistical filtering in improving classification robustness. These\nresults highlight the potential of automatic graph generation over traditional\nheuristic approaches and open new directions for broader applications in NLP."}

Due to the varying complexity of real-world\nqueries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost\nefficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an\nadaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent\norchestration.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel\ndiversified pipeline to synthesize BoostQA, a 100B-token large-scale QA\ndataset. Our synthesis framework: (1) curates seed data from heterogeneous\nsources; (2) utilizes DeepSeek-R1 to implement STEM-focused multi-grade\nsynthesis to boost data diversity and high-difficulty synthesis to mitigate\ndifficulty degradation; (3) refines answers via DeepSeek-V3 to improve output\nquality. We utilize BoostQA in mid-training, a mid-stage between pre-training\nand post-training, to optimize domain-specific knowledge acquisition and\nenhance data quality. Our method enables Llama-3 8B, mid-trained on a 40B-token\ndataset, to achieve an average improvement of $\\mathbf{12.74\\%}$ on MMLU and\nCMMLU and establish SOTA average performance across 12 benchmarks.

Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the\nmodel is prone to \"catastrophic forgetting\", resulting in the loss of\npreviously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem,\nwe propose a new CKGE model BAKE. First, we note that the Bayesian posterior\nupdate principle provides a natural continual learning strategy that is\ninsensitive to data order and can theoretically effectively resist the\nforgetting of previous knowledge during data evolution. Different from the\nexisting CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update\nof the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution\nof the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of\nearly snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly,\nwe propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly\ncombats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or\nchange amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots.

In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel\nframework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the\nform of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We\nuse a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks\nand semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct\nstructured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable\npathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions,\nproviding a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE\ncan significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models\n(4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior\nmethods for unstructured multi-LLM debates. We thus demonstrate the advantages\nof incorporating formal, argumentative reasoning mechanisms when combining\nmultiple LLM outputs."}

A\ncommon conjecture is that language models' reliance on subword units, rather\nthan characters, contributes to their struggles with character-level tasks, yet\nrecent studies offer conflicting conclusions about the role of tokenization,\nleaving its impact unclear. To address this gap, we introduce CharBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark of character-level tasks that is two orders of\nmagnitude larger than existing alternatives. We evaluate a diverse range of\nleading open-weight and proprietary models on CharBench and find that it\npresents a significant challenge to modern LLMs, with an average accuracy of\n43.6% and 32.3% on some tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of how intrinsic\nproperties of words and their segmentations into tokens correspond to model\nperformance. For counting tasks, we find that tokenization properties are\nweakly correlated with correctness, while the length of the queried word and\nthe actual character count play a more significant part. In contrast, for tasks\nrequiring intra-word positional understanding, performance is negatively\ncorrelated with the length of the token containing the queried character,\nsuggesting that longer tokens obscure character position information for LLMs.\nWe encourage future work to build on the benchmark and evaluation methodology\nintroduced here as tools for improving model performance on such tasks."}

However, mainstream preference\nmodeling in RM is inadequate in terms of token-level interaction, making its\njudgment signals vulnerable to being hacked by misallocated attention to\ncontext. This stems from two fundamental limitations: (1) Current preference\nmodeling employs decoder-only architectures, where the unidirectional causal\nattention mechanism leads to forward-decaying intra-sequence attention within\nthe prompt-response sequence. (2) The independent Siamese-encoding paradigm\ninduces the absence of token-level inter-sequence attention between chosen and\nrejected sequences. To address this \"attention hacking\", we propose\n\"Interaction Distillation\", a novel training framework for more adequate\npreference modeling through attention-level optimization. The method introduces\nan interaction-based natural language understanding model as the teacher to\nprovide sophisticated token interaction patterns via comprehensive attention,\nand guides the preference modeling to simulate teacher model's interaction\npattern through an attentional alignment objective. Through extensive\nexperiments, interaction distillation has demonstrated its ability to provide\nmore stable and generalizable reward signals compared to state-of-the-art RM\noptimization methods that target data noise, highlighting the attention hacking\nconstitute a more fundamental limitation in RM."}

Unlike standard attention\nmechanisms that compute $O(N^2)$ pairwise interactions, our approach uses\nlayer-wise pointer chaining where each layer's pointer selection depends on\nprevious layer's pointer positions, creating explicit long-distance connections\nthrough pointer chains. We demonstrate that this architecture achieves\n$2$--$10\\times$ speedup on long sequences compared to standard transformers,\nmaintains $>95\\%$ accuracy on copy tasks at distances up to 2048 tokens, and\nlearns interpretable pointer patterns that reveal structured dependency\nmodeling. Our experiments on efficiency benchmarks, long-range dependency\ntasks, and interpretability analysis show that Pointer offers a compelling\nalternative to attention mechanisms for scenarios requiring efficient\nlong-range modeling without pre-training dependencies."}

We compare the performance difference across\nseveral LLMs with the original and revised versions of the datasets and\nidentify large differences (almost 10% in some cases) in both languages). Based\non these results, we argue that test sets should not be considered immutable\nand should be revisited, checked for correctness, and potentially versioned.
