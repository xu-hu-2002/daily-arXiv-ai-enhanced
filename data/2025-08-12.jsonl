In this paper, we present the Indian Bail Prediction\nSystem (IBPS), an AI-powered framework designed to assist in bail\ndecision-making by predicting outcomes and generating legally sound rationales\nbased solely on factual case attributes and statutory provisions. We curate and\nrelease a large-scale dataset of 150,430 High Court bail judgments, enriched\nwith structured annotations such as age, health, criminal history, crime\ncategory, custody duration, statutes, and judicial reasoning. We fine-tune a\nlarge language model using parameter-efficient techniques and evaluate its\nperformance across multiple configurations, with and without statutory context,\nand with RAG. Our results demonstrate that models fine-tuned with statutory\nknowledge significantly outperform baselines, achieving strong accuracy and\nexplanation quality, and generalize well to a test set independently annotated\nby legal experts. IBPS offers a transparent, scalable, and reproducible\nsolution to support data-driven legal assistance, reduce bail delays, and\npromote procedural fairness in the Indian judicial system."}

This is because LLMs lack an accurate\nunderstanding of event triggers and tend to make over-interpretation, which\ncannot be effectively corrected through in-context examples alone. In this\npaper, we focus on the most challenging one-shot setting and propose KeyCP++, a\nkeyword-centric chain-of-thought prompting approach. KeyCP++ addresses the\nweaknesses of conventional ICL by automatically annotating the logical gaps\nbetween input text and detection results for the demonstrations. Specifically,\nto generate in-depth and meaningful rationale, KeyCP++ constructs a trigger\ndiscrimination prompting template. It incorporates the exemplary triggers\n(a.k.a keywords) into the prompt as the anchor to simply trigger profiling, let\nLLM propose candidate triggers, and justify each candidate. These\npropose-and-judge rationales help LLMs mitigate over-reliance on the keywords\nand promote detection rule learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach, showcasing significant advancements in one-shot\nevent detection."}

This study is the first to reveal that\nstrategically embedded persuasive language can bias LLM judges when scoring\nmathematical reasoning tasks, where correctness should be independent of\nstylistic variation. Grounded in Aristotle's rhetorical principles, we\nformalize seven persuasion techniques (Majority, Consistency, Flattery,\nReciprocity, Pity, Authority, Identity) and embed them into otherwise identical\nresponses.

While quantitative evaluations of compositional and\nnon-compositional approaches in SA exist in NLP, similar quantitative\nevaluations are very rare in FA in Linguistics that deal with linguistic\nexpressions representing focus or emphasis such as \"it was John who left\". We\nfill this gap in research by arguing that compositional rules in SA also apply\nto FA because FA and SA are closely related meaning that SA is part of FA. Our\ncompositional approach in SA exploits basic syntactic rules such as rules of\nmodification, coordination, and negation represented in the formalism of\nUniversal Dependencies (UDs) in English and applied to words representing\nsentiments from sentiment dictionaries. Some of the advantages of our\ncompositional analysis method for SA in contrast to non-compositional analysis\nmethods are interpretability and explainability. We test the accuracy of our\ncompositional approach and compare it with a non-compositional approach VADER\nthat uses simple heuristic rules to deal with negation, coordination and\nmodification.

To this end, we evaluate both\nindividual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized\ndomains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent\ndiscussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are\ntasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and\njustifications before finalizing their labels. Additionally, we incorporate\nreasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) to enable a more comprehensive comparison.

A key challenge underlying this limitation is the\nmodality gap between speech and text representations.

In each\ntraining iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between\nspeech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,\nthen incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to\noptimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with\ntranscript embeddings.

Results show that\nGPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art\naccuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in\nmultimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and\nunderstanding scores by +29.62% and +36.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and\nsurpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in\nunderstanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in\nmost dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to\nintegrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain,\nrecommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on\nthese controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from\nhuman-comparable to above human-expert performance. This improvement may\nsubstantially inform the design of future clinical decision-support systems."}

To address this\nchallenge, we propose PsyCrisis-Bench, a reference-free evaluation benchmark\nbased on real-world Chinese mental health dialogues. It evaluates whether the\nmodel responses align with the safety principles defined by experts.\nSpecifically designed for settings without standard references, our method\nadopts a prompt-based LLM-as-Judge approach that conducts in-context evaluation\nusing expert-defined reasoning chains grounded in psychological intervention\nprinciples. We employ binary point-wise scoring across multiple safety\ndimensions to enhance the explainability and traceability of the evaluation.\nAdditionally, we present a manually curated, high-quality Chinese-language\ndataset covering self-harm, suicidal ideation, and existential distress,\nderived from real-world online discourse. Experiments on 3600 judgments show\nthat our method achieves the highest agreement with expert assessments and\nproduces more interpretable evaluation rationales compared to existing\napproaches. Our dataset and evaluation tool are publicly available to\nfacilitate further research."}

They are widely\nused by leading AI companies as internal tools for red teaming and alignment\nevaluation. For example, if a safety-aligned model produces harmful outputs\nsimilar to an unlimited model, this indicates alignment failures that require\nfurther attention. Despite their essential role in assessing alignment, such\nmodels are not available to the research community.\n  We introduce Jinx, a helpful-only variant of popular open-weight LLMs. Jinx\nresponds to all queries without refusals or safety filtering, while preserving\nthe base model's capabilities in reasoning and instruction following. It\nprovides researchers with an accessible tool for probing alignment failures,\nevaluating safety boundaries, and systematically studying failure modes in\nlanguage model safety."}
