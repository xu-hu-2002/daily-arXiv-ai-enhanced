The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely\nforgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall\nutility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often\nutilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI\nservices for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However,\ndependence on these external resources is often impractical and could\npotentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct\ntoken optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs\nthat directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for\nexternal resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of\ntokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the\nremaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model\nutility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the\nlatter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show\nthat the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\\times$ improvement in forget quality\non several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a\ncomparable level of model utility."}

Building on\nthis, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI\nagents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i)\nspatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of\nhidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii)\ntemporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the\ncurrent frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history.

To address this gap, we propose a noise synthesis framework and new\nmetrics to evaluate the robustness of REAL-MT systematically. Using this\nframework, we instantiate REAL-MT with Qwen-series models, including standard\nLLMs and large reasoning models (LRMs) with enhanced reasoning, and evaluate\ntheir performance on idiomatic translation across high-, medium-, and\nlow-resource language pairs under synthesized noise. Our results show that\nlow-resource language pairs, which rely more heavily on retrieved context,\ndegrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones and often produce\nnonsensical translations. Although LRMs possess enhanced reasoning\ncapabilities, they show no improvement in error correction and are even more\nsusceptible to noise, tending to rationalize incorrect contexts. We find that\nthis stems from an attention shift away from the source idiom to noisy content,\nwhile confidence increases despite declining accuracy, indicating poor\ncalibration. To mitigate these issues, we investigate training-free and\nfine-tuning strategies, which improve robustness at the cost of performance in\nclean contexts, revealing a fundamental trade-off.

To address this gap, we introduce\nManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic,\nhuman-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a\npragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe\naction that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set,\nwhere potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's\npragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe.

Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to\nalgorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level\ndriver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically\nfavor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive\npsychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference\ndatasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.\nMotivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,\ntraining-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the\nmodel to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g.,\n``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities'').\nComprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance\nacross creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation,\nopen-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual\naccuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity\nby 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that\nmore capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new\ndata-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy\nthat helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity."}

Model editing offers a lightweight alternative\nto retraining, but sequential editing often destabilizes representations and\ninduces catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we seek to better understand and\nmitigate performance degradation caused by sequential editing. We hypothesize\nthat hyperspherical uniformity, a property that maintains uniform distribution\nof neuron weights on a hypersphere, helps the model remain stable, retain prior\nknowledge, while still accommodate new updates. We use Hyperspherical Energy\n(HE) to quantify neuron uniformity during editing, and examine its correlation\nwith editing performance. Empirical studies across widely used editing methods\nreveals a strong correlation between HE dynamics and editing performance, with\nediting failures consistently coinciding with high HE fluctuations. We further\ntheoretically prove that HE dynamics impose a lower bound on the degradation of\npretrained knowledge, highlighting why HE stability is crucial for knowledge\nretention. Motivated by these insights, we propose SPHERE (Sparse Projection\nfor Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing), an HE-driven regularization\nstrategy that stabilizes neuron weight distributions, ultimately preserving\nprior knowledge while enabling reliable sequential updates. Specifically,\nSPHERE identifies a sparse space complementary to the principal hyperspherical\ndirections of the pretrained weight matrices and projects new knowledge onto\nit, attenuating perturbations on the principal directions. Extensive\nexperiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show that SPHERE outperforms the\nbest baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41%, while most\nfaithfully preserving general model performance, thereby offering a principled\npath toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing."}
