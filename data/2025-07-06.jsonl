Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning\ncapabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,\nwhether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more\nvulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,\nsuggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype\nreinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those\nrelying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing\nattacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped\ninstructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently\nimproves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to\nreasoning design."}

The emergence of reasoning-capable\nmodels has further widened the cost gap between \"thinking\" (high reasoning) and\n\"non-thinking\" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that\napproximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the\nnon-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.\nThis highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that\ndynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could\noptimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,\nwe further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing\nframework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or\nnon-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets\ndemonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.\n0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by\n36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis\nindicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays\nand even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.\nFinally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index\nto comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token\ncost."}

Even today's strongest models struggle with\nfulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a\nsmall set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these\nabilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to\ngeneralize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,\nIFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,\ndiverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints.

These shortcuts arise from a\nfundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations\nof the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to\nbe no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this\nhas changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer\nmatching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it\ngenerate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the\nreference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare\nthe validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and\nGPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each\nevaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small\nones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator\nagreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using\nLLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.\nImproving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:\nthe rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their\nfree-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we\ndiscuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer\nmatching."}
