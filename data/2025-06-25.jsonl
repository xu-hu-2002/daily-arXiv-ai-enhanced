While current Transformer-based language\nmodels have shown strong performance on Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks,\nthey often rely on memorisation rather than rule-based inference. This work\ninvestigates how reasoning rules can be explicitly embedded and memorised\nwithin the LMs through Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a\ncomplete pipeline for learning reasoning rules within Transformer-based\nlanguage VAEs. This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a\nsupporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The\nexperiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under\nexplicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings -\ncan be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation\nresults in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior\nknowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the\nmodel to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on\nKey. This approach offers a simple method for integrating prior knowledge into\ndecoder-only language models. Performance bottleneck: In mathematical reasoning\ntasks using Qwen2.5(0.5B), increasing sample count doesn't improve performance\nbeyond a point.

While recent work in efficient\nreasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it\nremains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the\nintuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model\nresponses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether\nefficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To\nsystematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to\nmeasure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across\ntask settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned\nbehavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and\nself-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,\nwe find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than\nsmaller ones, they all display widespread \"scheming\" behaviors, including\nself-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning\ncues.

In this study, we address the\nproblem of classifying 18 Arabic dialects of the QADI dataset of Arabic tweets.\nRNN models, Transformer models, and large language models (LLMs) via prompt\nengineering are created and tested. Among these, MARBERTv2 performed best with\n65% accuracy and 64% F1-score. Through the use of state-of-the-art\npreprocessing techniques and the latest NLP models, this paper identifies the\nmost significant linguistic issues in Arabic dialect identification. The\nresults corroborate applications like personalized chatbots that respond in\nusers' dialects, social media monitoring, and greater accessibility for Arabic\ncommunities."}

Replacing Multi-Head-Attention with Bidirectional Recurrent Attention for Long-Form ASR", "comment": "Accepted to Interspeech 2025", "summary": "Long-form speech recognition is an application area of increasing research\nfocus. ASR models based on multi-head attention (MHA) are ill-suited to\nlong-form ASR because of their quadratic complexity in sequence length. We\nbuild on recent work that has investigated linear complexity recurrent\nattention (RA) layers for ASR. We find that bidirectional RA layers can match\nthe accuracy of MHA for both short- and long-form applications. We present a\nstrong limited-context attention (LCA) baseline, and show that RA layers are\njust as accurate while being more efficient. We develop a long-form training\nparadigm which further improves RA performance, leading to better accuracy than\nLCA with 44% higher throughput. We also present Direction Dropout, a novel\nregularization method that improves accuracy, provides fine-grained control of\nthe accuracy/throughput trade-off of bidirectional RA, and enables a new\nalternating directions decoding mode with even higher throughput."}

Through\ncomprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and\nintegration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key\ndifferences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes\nto LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective\noptimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training\neffectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both\nfine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach\nsimultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using\ndemonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage\nsequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average\naccuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks."}

In this work, we investigate strategies to\nenhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed\ndataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three\ndimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our\nanalysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as\nthe primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task\ncomplexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality\ndemonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance.\nWe leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology,\ndemonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical\nreasoning capabilities."}

Despite its critical importance, the\nclassification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in\nexisting research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text\nthat incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data\nsourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model\ntailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the\nissue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,\nwhich facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble\nmodel. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a\nmacro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In\naddition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed\ninstances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to\noccasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high\nconfidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we\nidentified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,\nparticularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal\nand non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied\nLIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in\nunderstanding context, contributing to errors in classification. These findings\nhighlight the promise of NLP and interpretability tools in reducing online\ncommunal violence. Our work contributes to the growing body of research in\ncommunal violence detection and offers a foundation for future studies aiming\nto refine these techniques for better accuracy and societal impact."}

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis\n(MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role\nassignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical\ndiagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist\nTeam, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an\nLLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient\nknowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.\nExtensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly\naccessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and\nvideo modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance\nof modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance\nimprovements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models.
