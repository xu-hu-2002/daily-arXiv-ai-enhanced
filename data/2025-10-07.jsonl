RxT processes each conversational turn\nas a discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated,\nfixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system.

However, existing approaches based\non phones often rely on costly resources such as grapheme-to-phoneme converters\n(G2Ps) and struggle to generalize to languages with ambiguous phoneme\nboundaries due to training instability. In this paper, we address both\nchallenges by introducing a syllable-level UASR framework based on masked\nlanguage modeling, which avoids the need for G2P and the instability of\nGAN-based methods. Our approach achieves up to a 40\\% relative reduction in\ncharacter error rate (CER) on LibriSpeech and generalizes effectively to\nMandarin, a language that has remained particularly difficult for prior\nmethods.

While this insight naturally leads to penalty-based approaches,\nthey ignore crucial distinctions in how models distribute uncertainty, for\nexample between hedging toward incorrect answers versus hedging toward \"I don't\nknow\" responses. A novel evaluation metric, the Distributional Correctness\nScore (DCS), is introduced to solve this problem, i.e., of not considering a\nmodel's entire probability distribution over answer choices.

Code available at:\n  https://github.com/sirraya-tech/Sirraya_LSD_Code", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet factually incorrect\nstatements-a phenomenon known as hallucination-posing serious risks in\nhigh-stakes domains. We present Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD), a geometric\nframework for hallucination detection that analyzes the evolution of\nhidden-state semantics across transformer layers. Unlike prior methods that\nrely on multiple sampling passes or external verification sources, LSD operates\nintrinsically within the model's representational space. Using margin-based\ncontrastive learning, LSD aligns hidden activations with ground-truth\nembeddings derived from a factual encoder, revealing a distinct separation in\nsemantic trajectories: factual responses preserve stable alignment, while\nhallucinations exhibit pronounced semantic drift across depth. Evaluated on the\nTruthfulQA and synthetic factual-hallucination datasets, LSD achieves an\nF1-score of 0.92, AUROC of 0.96, and clustering accuracy of 0.89, outperforming\nSelfCheckGPT and Semantic Entropy baselines while requiring only a single\nforward pass. This efficiency yields a 5-20x speedup over sampling-based\nmethods without sacrificing precision or interpretability. LSD offers a\nscalable, model-agnostic mechanism for real-time hallucination monitoring and\nprovides new insights into the geometry of factual consistency within large\nlanguage models."}

The core challenge stems from a lack of awareness, as standard\nmodels are pre-trained on general corpora, leaving them blind to the\ndomain-specific language and narrative context inherent to the data. To address\nthis, we introduce AWARE, a framework that systematically attempts to improve a\ntransformer model's awareness for this nuanced task. AWARE has three core\ncomponents: 1) Domain Awareness, adapting the model's vocabulary to the\nlinguistic style of student reflections; 2) Context Awareness, generating\nsentence embeddings that are aware of the full essay context; and 3) Class\nOverlap Awareness, employing a multi-label strategy to recognize the\ncoexistence of themes in a single sentence.

This raises a natural question: can multiple SLMs be orchestrated into a\nsystem where each contributes effectively, achieving higher accuracy than any\nindividual model? Existing orchestration methods have primarily targeted\nfrontier models (e.g., GPT-4) and perform suboptimally when applied to SLMs. To\naddress this gap, we propose a three-stage approach for orchestrating SLMs.\nFirst, we introduce SLM-MUX, a multi-model architecture that effectively\ncoordinates multiple SLMs. Building on this, we develop two optimization\nstrategies: (i) a model selection search that identifies the most complementary\nSLMs from a given pool, and (ii) test-time scaling tailored to SLM-MUX. Our\napproach delivers strong results: Compared to existing orchestration methods,\nour approach achieves up to 13.4% improvement on MATH, 8.8% on GPQA, and 7.0%\non GSM8K.

However, the\nvanilla decoding strategy in discrete dLLMs suffers from a critical limitation:\nonce a token is accepted, it can no longer be revised in subsequent steps. As a\nresult, early mistakes persist across iterations, harming both intermediate\npredictions and final output quality. To address this issue, we propose\nTolerator (Token-Level Cross-Validation Refinement), a training-free decoding\nstrategy that leverages cross-validation among predicted tokens.
