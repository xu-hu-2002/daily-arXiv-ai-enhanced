Building Rational Agents that Explore and Act Like People", "comment": null, "summary": "Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses\nand making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given\nlimited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act\nrationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic\ninformation-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we\nintroduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative\nBattleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration\n(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter\nmust provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to\nhuman players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in\ncontext, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,\nto address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for\nLMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter\nagents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only\nbaselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up\nto 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these\ncomponents yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,\nsuch as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and\nfrontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We\nreplicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost\naccuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for\nbuilding rational information-seeking agents."}

Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and\nproximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from\ndemonstration data.

However, their\napplication to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock\nmovement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class\nclassification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning\nresponses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit\na systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from\ndifferent sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such\ncounterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model\ndoes not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To\naddress this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start\nmethod prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While\ngenerating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical\nframework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for\nprice up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual\nviewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach\nmaximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring\nindependent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We\nalso build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,\nwith long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and\nnews, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental\ndata, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that\nRETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial\ndomain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on\nout-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock\nmovement prediction."}

Existing accounts, from classical logic to\nprobabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but\ndo not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning\ndynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),\nthat uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify\ninformation entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained\nanalyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the\nuniversal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.\nWe show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies\nsystematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to\ndiscussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus\ndual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and\nhuman cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process.
