In\nthis paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose\nLinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient\nframework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage\nretrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical\ngraph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic\nlinking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph\nconstruction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token\nconsumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original\npassages.

Our framework employs\n176 distinct perturbation strategies across six categories of informational\nuncertainty and three intensity levels. Evaluation of over 30 models uncovers\nsystematic failure patterns: refusal comprises separable detection and\ncategorization skills, and neither scale nor extended reasoning improves\nperformance.

Here, we propose RAGen, a scalable\nand modular framework for generating domain-grounded question-answer-context\n(QAC) triples tailored to diverse RAG adaptation approaches. RAGen produces\nthese QAC triples by identifying key concepts in documents, generating diverse\nquestions guided by Bloom's Taxonomy-inspired principles, and pairing them with\nprecise answers extracted from relevant contexts. RAGen supports multiple RAG\nadaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the\nLLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features\nsemantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval,\nalong with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust\nreasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and\nevolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially\nsuitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and\nenterprise knowledge bases."}

Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques\nthat require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL\nthat strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility\nboundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour. Our framework\ncombines two components: (i) introspection, where the model generates and\nclassifies tasks it judges feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based\nrewarding, where stability of self-knowledge assessment is reinforced through\ninternal agreement. By using internally generated data, this design strengthens\nconsistency in self-knowledge and entirely avoids costly external supervision.\nIn experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL steadily improved\nself-knowledge, validated by both intrinsic self-consistency and extrinsic\nbenchmarking. With nothing more than a small seed set and no external\nsupervision, our method drove gains as high as 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1,\noutperforming baselines in just a few iterations. Our framework essentially\nunlocks the untapped capacity of LLMs to self-improve their knowledge\nawareness, opening the door to reliable, more accountable AI and safer\ndeployment in critical applications. Owing to its simplicity and independence\nfrom external effort, we encourage applying this reliability-enhancing process\nto all future models."}

Extensive\nexperiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its\neffectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities.\nFurthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL),\nshowing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive\nrefinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This\nsuggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm\nfor enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of\nGRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on\nits representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource\nvisual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining\nbefore CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding\ncapabilities.

To address these gaps, we introduce\nAgent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for\nevaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates\nverified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures\nwithin a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison\nunder real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a\nsingle-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk\nstyles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them\nacross GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and\nGemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets\ndemonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral\npatterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making,\nwhereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus\nestablishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving\nevaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents."}

In this work, we conduct a\ncomprehensive and systematic investigation to demystify reinforcement learning\nin agentic reasoning from three key perspectives: data, algorithm, and\nreasoning mode. We highlight our key insights: (i) Replacing stitched synthetic\ntrajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories yields a far stronger\nSFT initialization; high-diversity, model-aware datasets sustain exploration\nand markedly improve RL performance. (ii) Exploration-friendly techniques are\ncrucial for agentic RL, such as clip higher, overlong reward shaping, and\nmaintaining adequate policy entropy could improve the training efficiency.\n(iii) A deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls outperforms frequent tool\ncalls or verbose self-reasoning, improving tool efficiency and final accuracy.\nTogether, these simple practices consistently enhance agentic reasoning and\ntraining efficiency, achieving strong results on challenging benchmarks with\nsmaller models, and establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL\nresearch. Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a\nhigh-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL\ndataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the\nagentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including\nAIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6. With our recipes,\n4B-sized models could also achieve superior agentic reasoning performance\ncompared to 32B-sized models. Code and models:\nhttps://github.com/Gen-Verse/Open-AgentRL"}

Gonzalez"], "title": "Are Large Reasoning Models Interruptible?", "comment": "Project Page: https://dynamic-lm.github.io/", "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are\ntraditionally evaluated in static, \"frozen world\" settings: model responses are\nassumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be\nimmutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for\nshort-term tasks, the \"frozen world\" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning\ntasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think\nthrough problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model\nstarts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the\nfrozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic\nscenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs\non a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to\nin-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require\nlong-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness:\neven state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can\nfail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with\nperformance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the\nreasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes,\nincluding reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final\nanswer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon\nreasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where\nperformance degrades while incorporating updated information."}
