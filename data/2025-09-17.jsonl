To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising\nsemi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five\ntrait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance\nacross three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with\nGPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA\narchitectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT\nand OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson\ncorrelations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits\nremain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with\nvalidated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal\ngains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on\nlatent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings\nunderscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and\nmotivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and\nalignment-oriented fine-tuning."}

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on\nchart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when\nmodels attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present\nChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during\nchart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model\nattention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced\ninterpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided\nattention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our\napproach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains\nof up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results\ndemonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the\nreasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs."}

We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic\nfoundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn\ndiverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby\ncreating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to\npropose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the\ndeep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational\nmodels.

Diverse real-world APIs demand\nprecise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop\nthese capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of\nfunction-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in\nwhich agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step\ntowards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central\nchallenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how\nto effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through\ninteractions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable\nframework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are\nfully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling\nscenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first\nendowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them\nfor domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks,\ntau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model,\nAgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models."}

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human\nresearch process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively\ninterleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a\ncomprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.\nThe writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,\ncomposing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of\nonly the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively\nmitigates long-context issues.

To overcome this\nchallenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite\nexploration through periodic context summarization.

For paradigm adaptation,\nwe propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and\nadvantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned\nreasoning.

We critically evaluate\npopular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that\nthey succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,\nsuggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization\nmethods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations\noften reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated\nthem, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded.
