However, manual coding is both difficult and\ntime-consuming, making it impractical at scale. Automated coding can\npotentially alleviate this burden, improving the availability and accuracy of\nstructured clinical data. The task is difficult to automate, as it requires\nmapping to high-dimensional and long-tailed target spaces, such as the\nInternational Classification of Diseases (ICD). While external knowledge\nsources have been readily utilised to enhance output code representation, the\nuse of external resources for representing the input documents has been\nunderexplored. In this work, we compute a structured representation of the\ninput documents, making use of document-level knowledge graphs (KGs) that\nprovide a comprehensive structured view of a patient's condition. The resulting\nknowledge graph efficiently represents the patient-centred input documents with\n23\\% of the original text while retaining 90\\% of the information.

Our empirical evaluations using five LLMs\nand three tasks show that CLAP improves hallucination detection compared to\nbaselines on both greedy decoded responses as well as responses sampled at\nhigher temperatures, thus enabling fine-grained detection, i.e. the ability to\ndisambiguate hallucinations and non-hallucinations among different sampled\nresponses to a given prompt.

The system is designed to assist patients by providing\naccurate medical advice, diagnoses, drug recommendations, and treatment plans\nbased on user input. The research methodology required the collection of a\nunique dataset from social media platforms, capturing real-world medical\nconversations between patients and doctors. The dataset, which includes patient\ncomplaints together with medical advice, was properly cleaned and preprocessed\nto account for multiple Arabic dialects. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art\ngenerative models, such as Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, LLaMA-2-7B, and GPT-2\nMedium, optimized the system's ability to generate reliable medical text.\nResults from evaluations indicate that the fine-tuned Mistral-7B model\noutperformed the other models, achieving average BERT (Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers) Score values in precision, recall, and\nF1-scores of 68.5\\%, 69.08\\%, and 68.5\\%, respectively. Comparative\nbenchmarking and qualitative assessments validate the system's ability to\nproduce coherent and relevant medical replies to informal input. This study\nhighlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in\nadvancing HMS, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for global healthcare\nchallenges, especially in linguistically and culturally diverse environments."}

While prior\nefforts compiled a dataset of 20,000 Arabic patient-doctor interactions from\nsocial media to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), model scalability and\ngeneralization remained limited. In this study, we propose a scalable synthetic\ndata augmentation strategy to expand the training corpus to 100,000 records.\nUsing advanced generative AI systems ChatGPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro we generated\n80,000 contextually relevant and medically coherent synthetic question-answer\npairs grounded in the structure of the original dataset. These synthetic\nsamples were semantically filtered, manually validated, and integrated into the\ntraining pipeline. We fine-tuned five LLMs, including Mistral-7B and AraGPT2,\nand evaluated their performance using BERTScore metrics and expert-driven\nqualitative assessments. To further analyze the effectiveness of synthetic\nsources, we conducted an ablation study comparing ChatGPT-4o and\nGemini-generated data independently. The results showed that ChatGPT-4o data\nconsistently led to higher F1-scores and fewer hallucinations across all\nmodels.

Most existing LLM-based social\nsimulation studies focus primarily on designing agentic frameworks and\nsimulation environments, often overlooking the complexities of persona\ngeneration and the potential biases introduced by unrepresentative persona\nsets. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for synthesizing\nhigh-quality, population-aligned persona sets for LLM-driven social simulation.\nOur approach begins by leveraging LLMs to generate narrative personas from\nlong-term social media data, followed by rigorous quality assessment to filter\nout low-fidelity profiles.

We examine this phenomenon of incongruent\npositivity as miscalibrated expressions of positive support in both human and\nLLM generated responses. To this end, we collected real user-assistant\ndialogues from Reddit across a range of emotional intensities and generated\nadditional responses using large language models for the same context. We\ncategorize these conversations by intensity into two levels: Mild, which covers\nrelationship tension and general advice, and Severe, which covers grief and\nanxiety conversations. This level of categorization enables a comparative\nanalysis of how supportive responses vary across lower and higher stakes\ncontexts. Our analysis reveals that LLMs are more prone to unrealistic\npositivity through dismissive and minimizing tone, particularly in high-stakes\ncontexts. To further study the underlying dimensions of this phenomenon, we\nfinetune LLMs on datasets with strong and weak emotional reactions. Moreover,\nwe developed a weakly supervised multilabel classifier ensemble (DeBERTa and\nMentalBERT) that shows improved detection of incongruent positivity types\nacross two sorts of concerns (Mild and Severe). Our findings shed light on the\nneed to move beyond merely generating generic positive responses and instead\nstudy the congruent support measures to balance positive affect with emotional\nacknowledgment.

However, though\nonly a few experts are activated for each token, SMoE still requires loading\nall expert parameters, leading to high memory usage and challenges in\ndeployment. Previous work has tried to reduce the overhead by pruning and\nmerging experts, but primarily focused on expert-level operations, leaving\nneuron-level structure underexplored. We propose DERN (Dropping Experts,\nRecombining Neurons), a task-agnostic and retraining-free framework for expert\npruning and reconstruction. We observe that experts are often misaligned and\ncontain semantic conflicts at the neuron level, which poses challenges for\ndirect merging. To solve this, DERN works in three steps: it first prunes\nredundant experts using router statistics; then it decomposes them into\nneuron-level expert segments, assigning each segment to its most compatible\nretained expert; and finally, it merges segments within each retained expert to\nbuild a compact representation. Experiments on Mixtral, Qwen, and DeepSeek SMoE\nmodels show that DERN improves performance by more than 5% on commonsense\nreasoning and MMLU benchmarks under 50% expert sparsity, without extra\ntraining.

This has led to\nclaims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a\nfew shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply\nlearning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the\nmodels rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue\nthat, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full\ncharacterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale\nanalysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,\ndistributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an\neffective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise\nto unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more\nnumerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt\nstyle, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from\nregularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity,\nespecially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought.
