These agents address the limitations of their parametric memory by\ndynamically gathering relevant facts to address complex reasoning tasks.\nHowever, existing approaches suffer from a fundamental architectural\nlimitation: they process search queries strictly sequentially, even when\nhandling inherently parallelizable and logically independent comparisons. This\nsequential bottleneck significantly constrains computational efficiency,\nparticularly for queries that require multiple entity comparisons. To address\nthis critical limitation, we propose ParallelSearch, a novel reinforcement\nlearning framework that empowers large language models (LLMs) to recognize\nparallelizable query structures and execute multiple search operations\nconcurrently. Our approach introduces dedicated reward functions that\nincentivize the identification of independent query components while preserving\nanswer accuracy through jointly considering correctness, query decomposition\nquality, and parallel execution benefits. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate\nthat ParallelSearch outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average\nperformance gain of 2.9% across seven question-answering benchmarks.

Our method is specifically designed to meet three key criteria for\nhigh-quality evaluation: representativeness, by ensuring comprehensive coverage\nof model capabilities; fairness, by remaining independent of model performance\nduring sample selection to avoid bias; and generalizability, by enabling\nflexible transfer across datasets and model families without reliance on\nlarge-scale evaluation data.

However, few works have noted the negative effects on SLM\nsafety brought by the training, which are revealed in this study. Although\nthere are works on safety alignment that fine-tune language models or\nmanipulate model weights to defend against harmful inputs, they require extra\ncomputation or annotated data, and probably impact the reasoning ability of\nSLMs. In this paper, we investigate how to maintain the safety of SLMs during\nthe CoT distillation process. Specifically, we propose a safe distillation\nmethod, Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking Distillation (SLowED), containing\ntwo modules: Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking. Slow Tuning scales down the\nmagnitude of model weight changes to optimize the model weights in the\nneighboring space near the initial weight distribution. Low-Entropy Masking\nmasks low-entropy tokens, which are regarded as unnecessary learning targets,\nto exclude them from fine-tuning. Experiments on three SLMs (Qwen2.5-1.5B,\nLlama-3.2-1B, BLOOM-1.1B) across reasoning benchmarks (BBH, BB-Sub, ARC,\nAGIEval) and safety evaluation (AdvBench) show that SLowED retains the safety\nof SLMs and comparably improves their reasoning capability compared to existing\ndistillation methods.

Our framework assesses methods along four key dimensions:\nalignment detection, alignment quality, computational efficiency, and\nrobustness. Through experiments across diverse base models and alignment\nstrategies, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in identifying\nstrengths and limitations of current state-of-the-art models, providing\nvaluable insights for future research directions."}

However, their ability to\ngenerate code from multimodal inputs remains limited. In this work, we\nintroduce VisCodex, a unified framework that seamlessly merges vision and\ncoding language models to empower MLLMs with strong multimodal code generation\nabilities. Leveraging a task vector-based model merging technique, we integrate\na state-of-the-art coding LLM into a strong vision-language backbone, while\npreserving both visual comprehension and advanced coding skills. To support\ntraining and evaluation, we introduce the Multimodal Coding Dataset (MCD), a\nlarge-scale and diverse collection of 598k samples, including high-quality HTML\ncode, chart image-code pairs, image-augmented StackOverflow QA, and algorithmic\nproblems. Furthermore, we propose InfiBench-V, a novel and challenging\nbenchmark specifically designed to assess models on visually-rich, real-world\nprogramming questions that demand a nuanced understanding of both textual and\nvisual contexts. Extensive experiments show that VisCodex achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs and approaches proprietary\nmodels like GPT-4o, highlighting the effectiveness of our model merging\nstrategy and new datasets."}

Tokenization Choices for Radiology Language Models", "comment": "Accepted to ELAMI@MICCAI2025", "summary": "The vocabulary used by language models (LM) - defined by the tokenizer -\nplays a key role in text generation quality. However, its impact remains\nunder-explored in radiology. In this work, we address this gap by\nsystematically comparing general, medical, and domain-specific tokenizers on\nthe task of radiology report summarisation across three imaging modalities. We\nalso investigate scenarios with and without LM pre-training on PubMed\nabstracts. Our findings demonstrate that medical and domain-specific\nvocabularies outperformed widely used natural language alternatives when models\nare trained from scratch. Pre-training partially mitigates performance\ndifferences between tokenizers, whilst the domain-specific tokenizers achieve\nthe most favourable results. Domain-specific tokenizers also reduce memory\nrequirements due to smaller vocabularies and shorter sequences. These results\ndemonstrate that adapting the vocabulary of LMs to the clinical domain provides\npractical benefits, including improved performance and reduced computational\ndemands, making such models more accessible and effective for both research and\nreal-world healthcare settings."}

Previous work studied\nannotator properties to explain disagreement, but this overlooks the\npossibility that ambiguity may stem from missing information about the context\nof events. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that adds reasonable\ncontexts to event descriptions, which may better explain a particular\nsituation. Our goal is to understand whether these enriched contexts enable\nhuman annotators to annotate emotions more reliably. We disambiguate a target\nevent description by automatically generating multiple event chains conditioned\non differing emotions. By combining techniques from short story generation in\nvarious settings, we achieve coherent narratives that result in a specialized\ndataset for the first comprehensive and systematic examination of\ncontextualized emotion analysis. Through automatic and human evaluation, we\nfind that contextual narratives enhance the interpretation of specific emotions\nand support annotators in producing more consistent annotations."}

GPT-5-high achieved\nthe highest accuracy (0.965; 95% CI, 0.942-0.985), outperforming all GPT-5-nano\nvariants (P < .001), o1-high (P = .04), and GPT-4o (P < .001), but not o3-high\n(0.958; 95% CI, 0.931-0.981).

Wav2Vec or Whisper? Applying both in Badini Kurdish Speech to Text (BKSTT)", "comment": "21 pages, 20 figures, 7 tables", "summary": "Speech-to-text (STT) systems have a wide range of applications. They are\navailable in many languages, albeit at different quality levels. Although\nKurdish is considered a less-resourced language from a processing perspective,\nSST is available for some of the Kurdish dialects, for instance, Sorani\n(Central Kurdish). However, that is not applied to other Kurdish dialects,\nBadini and Hawrami, for example. This research is an attempt to address this\ngap. Bandin, approximately, has two million speakers, and STT systems can help\ntheir community use mobile and computer-based technologies while giving their\ndialect more global visibility. We aim to create a language model based on\nBadini's speech and evaluate its performance. To cover a conversational aspect,\nhave a proper confidence level of grammatical accuracy, and ready\ntranscriptions, we chose Badini kids' stories, eight books including 78\nstories, as the textual input. Six narrators narrated the books, which resulted\nin approximately 17 hours of recording. We cleaned, segmented, and tokenized\nthe input. The preprocessing produced nearly 15 hours of speech, including\n19193 segments and 25221 words. We used Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 and\nWhisper-small to develop the language models. The experiments indicate that the\ntranscriptions process based on the Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53 model provides a\nsignificantly more accurate and readable output than the Whisper-small model,\nwith 90.38% and 65.45% readability, and 82.67% and 53.17% accuracy,\nrespectively."}

This\nproblem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft\nallow users to easily create custom LLM \"assistants\" specialized to particular\ntypes of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized\nand difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often\nbenefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can\nthen be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask.\nFor example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first\nselect an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary,\nand then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from\nthe summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms,\nthis setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of\neach LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus,\nunlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly\naffects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs,\ncreating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted\nfor during selection. We propose a neural contextual bandit-based algorithm\nthat trains neural networks that model LLM success on each subtask in an online\nmanner, thus learning to guide the LLM selections for the different subtasks,\neven in the absence of historical LLM performance data. Experiments on\ntelecommunications question answering and medical diagnosis prediction datasets\nillustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other LLM\nselection algorithms."}
