These limitations\nreduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal\ntasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video\nand audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text\nKnowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive\nmultimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information,\nwhere each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed\ndescriptions of concepts.

In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a\ntest-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate\nresponses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations\nin prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations\ncan be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained\nsparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of\nmultiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this\nanswer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be\ndown-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached\nactivations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional\nmodel queries.

However, their capacity to reason over\ncomplex, long lessons and intricate educational diagrams that cannot be\nrepresented as a single natural image remains largely untested. In this work,\nwe present the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on the textbook\nquestion answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We assess the\nperformance of recent vision-language models, including LLaVA and LLaMA\n3.2-Vision, across various input configurations. Additionally, we introduce a\nlightweight multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that\nintegrates both paragraphs and diagrams from the lesson into the prompt. Our\nresults demonstrate the influence of retrieved educational context on model\naccuracy and reasoning, while also revealing current limitations in handling\nquestion-context relationships and the potential for noise, pointing to key\ndirections for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning."}

While previous research has primarily focused on\nlocating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work\ninvestigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences\ndocument comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover\nthat raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which\nis a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and\nstructure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel\nstructure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex\nparadigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships\ncritical for comprehension.

Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous\nintelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as\nrepositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic\nexpression--\"fossils\" of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues\nwithout their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns\nonly become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive\nfeedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately\ncatalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal\nfeatures--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we\ndemonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium\nfor preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference\nto goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human\nculture without containing understanding of embodied human experience.\nTherefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human\nintelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful\nhypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework\npositions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to\ngenerate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human\ninterpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics\nand norms."}

Although autoregressive systems\nexhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token\ngeneration mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of\nsynthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video\ndubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces\nIndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for\nspeech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows\nexplicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration\ncontrol; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely\ngenerate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input\nprompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional\nexpression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and\nemotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the\nemotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a\nseparate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to\nreconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance\nclarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent\nrepresentations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier\nfor emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual\ndescriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3.

To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed.

In this paper, we define two\ntypes of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and\ninference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase\nevaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single\nverifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across\ndifferent query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically\nsensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or\nideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset\nspanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question\ntypes. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment,\nwhile Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and\nquery language.

To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we\npropose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques\nto enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the\nnewly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and\nLlama models.

In fact, a\nprevious study on emergent communication using models with hierarchical biases\nhave reported that agents adopting random parsing\nstrategies$\\unicode{x2013}$ones that deviate significantly from human language\ncomprehension$\\unicode{x2013}$can achieve high communication accuracy. In this\nstudy, we investigate this issue by making two simple and natural modifications\nto the experimental setup: (I) we use more complex inputs that have\nhierarchical structures, such that random parsing makes semantic interpretation\nmore difficult, and (II) we incorporate a surprisal-related term, which is\nknown to influence the order of words and characters in natural language, into\nthe objective function. With these changes, we evaluate whether agents\nemploying random parsing strategies still maintain high communication accuracy."}

Under submission", "summary": "Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in\nlarge language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost.\nWhile training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime\noptimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive\ndecoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,\nand speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or\ndisrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,\ntoken-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time\nwithout altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four\nsynergistic mechanisms:\n  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged\nrepresentations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory\nwrites to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which\ncollapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.\n  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on\nfrozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and\nLlama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP\nreduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2)."}

We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, investigating the\nCzech GEC corpora as bases for synthetic error introduction, several error\ngeneration strategies, domain balancing, tokenization granularity, model size,\nand data scaling during fine-tuning. Additionally, we evaluate the performance\nof large language models (LLMs) on Czech GEC in both end-user and expert\nfine-tuning scenarios. Our best-performing model is superior both in\nperformance and computational efficiency. The source code and the trained model\nlinks are available on https://github.com/ufal/tsd2025-gec."}

It delivers\ncompetitive performance against similarly sized models on Korea-focused\nbenchmarks such as KMMLU, CSAT, KoBALT-700, HAERAE-1.0, and KoBigBench, while\npreserving robust bilingual consistency and translation quality. In addition, a\nvision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM\nbenchmark, all of which are achieved with substantially lower training compute\nthan existing models of similar sizes.

However, most evaluations of language models\nrely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the\ncomplexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In\nclinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic\nhypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just\nlearned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final\ndiagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential\nDiagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New\nEngland Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases\ninto stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case\nabstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper\nmodel that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is\nassessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician\nvisits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator\n(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,\nproposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,\ncost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%\ndiagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist\nphysicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to\nphysicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum\naccuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO\ngeneralize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and\nLlama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively\nand act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in\nclinical care."}
