For Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (RMLLMs), this is uniquely challenging: intermediate chain-of-thought steps can still leak sensitive information even when final answers are forgotten, and overly aggressive interventions easily damage general reasoning ability. Yet no benchmark jointly evaluates how well unlearning methods suppress reasoning-level leakage while preserving reasoning competence. We address this gap with RMLLMU-Bench, the first benchmark for RMLLM unlearning that extends standard forgetting metrics with dedicated measures of reasoning leakage and reasoning retention. A systematic evaluation on RMLLMU-Bench reveals that existing unlearning methods for MLLMs and Large (Language) Reasoning Models (LRMs) either leave substantial leakage in the reasoning process or severely degrade reasoning performance. To address these gaps, we propose R-MUSE (Reasoning-preserving MLLM Unlearning via Subspace guidance and Adaptive Steering), a training-free and inference-time intervention framework that steers internal representations to forget both answers and reasoning traces while explicitly preserving general reasoning. Experiments on RMLLMU-Bench demonstrate that R-MUSE achieves a substantially better balance between effective forgetting and reasoning retention."}

A central challenge in this setting is question answering, which requires jointly leveraging unstructured text and the structured relational signals within the graph. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advances in natural language understanding, their direct use for reasoning over text-attributed graphs remains limited. Retrieval-augmented generation methods that operate purely on text often treat passages as isolated units, ignoring the interconnected structure of the graph. Conversely, graph-based RAG methods that serialize large subgraphs into long textual sequences quickly become infeasible due to LLM context-length constraints, resulting in fragmented reasoning and degraded accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Graph-O1, an agentic GraphRAG framework that enables LLMs to conduct stepwise, interactive reasoning over graphs. Our approach integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with end-to-end reinforcement learning, allowing the model to selectively explore and retrieve only the most informative subgraph components. The reasoning procedure is framed as a multi-turn interaction between the agent and the graph environment, and the agent is trained through a unified reward mechanism. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM backbones demonstrate that Graph-O1 consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing answers that are more accurate, reliable, and interpretable."}

Standard Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), with its focus on conciseness, fails to preserve narrative flow.

To demonstrate the critical role of temporal structure in this task, we introduce Temporal Alignment Event Graph (TAEG), a graph structure that explicitly models chronology and event alignment. By applying a standard centrality algorithm to TAEG, our method functions as a version selection mechanism, choosing the most central representation of each event in its correct temporal position. In a study on the four Biblical Gospels, this structure-focused approach guarantees perfect temporal ordering (Kendall's Tau of 1.000) by design and dramatically improves content metrics (e.g., +357.2% in ROUGE-L F1). The success of this baseline method validates the formulation of Narrative Consolidation as a relevant task and establishes that an explicit temporal backbone is a fundamental component for its resolution."}

To handle testing domains, domain adaptation (DA) is trained to adapt to a fixed and observed testing domain; a more challenging paradigm, test-time adaptation (TTA), cannot access the testing domain during training and online adapts to the testing samples during testing, where the samples are from a fixed domain. We aim to explore a more practical and underexplored scenario, continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) for text understanding, which involves a sequence of testing (unobserved) domains in testing. Current CTTA methods struggle in reducing error accumulation over domains and enhancing generalization to handle unobserved domains: 1) Noise-filtering reduces accumulated errors but discards useful information, and 2) accumulating historical domains enhances generalization, but it is hard to achieve adaptive accumulation. In this paper, we propose a CTTA-T (continual test-time adaptation for text understanding) framework adaptable to evolving target domains: it adopts a teacher-student framework, where the teacher is domain-aware and generalized for evolving domains. To improve teacher predictions, we propose a refine-then-filter based on dropout-driven consistency, which calibrates predictions and removes unreliable guidance. For the adaptation-generalization trade-off, we construct a domain-aware teacher by dynamically accumulating cross-domain semantics via incremental PCA, which continuously tracks domain shifts. Experiments show CTTA-T excels baselines."}

To better understand and mitigate this trade-off, we conduct a comprehensive study of reasoning strategies for reasoning models in RAG multi-hop QA tasks. Our findings reveal that reasoning models adopt structured strategies to integrate retrieved and internal knowledge, primarily following two modes: Context-Grounded Reasoning, which relies directly on retrieved content, and Knowledge-Reconciled Reasoning, which resolves conflicts or gaps using internal knowledge. To this end, we propose a novel Lightweight Rerank Reasoning Strategy Framework for RAG (LiR$^3$AG) to enable non-reasoning models to transfer reasoning strategies by restructuring retrieved evidence into coherent reasoning chains.

This paper presents AgentInfer, a unified framework for end-to-end agent acceleration that bridges inference optimization and architectural design. We decompose the problem into four synergistic components: AgentCollab, a hierarchical dual-model reasoning framework that balances large- and small-model usage through dynamic role assignment; AgentSched, a cache-aware hybrid scheduler that minimizes latency under heterogeneous request patterns; AgentSAM, a suffix-automaton-based speculative decoding method that reuses multi-session semantic memory to achieve low-overhead inference acceleration; and AgentCompress, a semantic compression mechanism that asynchronously distills and reorganizes agent memory without disrupting ongoing reasoning. Together, these modules form a Self-Evolution Engine capable of sustaining efficiency and cognitive stability throughout long-horizon reasoning tasks. Experiments on the BrowseComp-zh and DeepDiver benchmarks demonstrate that through the synergistic collaboration of these methods, AgentInfer reduces ineffective token consumption by over 50%, achieving an overall 1.8-2.5 times speedup with preserved accuracy.

We systematically compare BPE, WordPiece, and SentencePiece algorithms across multiple configurations, demonstrating that SentencePiece with normalization achieves 18% lower fertility (1.199 vs 1.35 tokens/word) compared to unnormalized baselines. Furthermore, we introduce the Language Extension Pipeline (LEP), a method for integrating the optimized tokenizer into Qwen3-0.6B through vocabulary extension with mean subtoken initialization and selective transformer layer unfreezing. Our experiments show that LEP reduces evaluation loss from 8.28 to 2.43 within 800 training steps on 100K Arabic samples. We release our tokenizer, training scripts, and model checkpoints to facilitate Arabic NLP research."}

We instantiate the framework in an interactive spoken consultation setting and evaluate it with medical students ($\\mathbf{N{=}14}$). Participants reported realistic and vignette-faithful dialogue, appropriate difficulty calibration, a stable personality signal, and highly useful example-rich feedback, alongside excellent overall usability.

Accepted by Radio Electronics Computer Science Control 2025", "summary": "This study presents a hybrid deep learning architecture that integrates LSTM, CNN, and an Attention mechanism to enhance the classification of web content based on text. Pretrained GloVe embeddings are used to represent words as dense vectors that preserve semantic similarity. The CNN layer extracts local n-gram patterns and lexical features, while the LSTM layer models long-range dependencies and sequential structure. The integrated Attention mechanism enables the model to focus selectively on the most informative parts of the input sequence. A 5-fold cross-validation setup was used to assess the robustness and generalizability of the proposed solution. Experimental results show that the hybrid LSTM-CNN-Attention model achieved outstanding performance, with an accuracy of 0.98, precision of 0.94, recall of 0.92, and F1-score of 0.93. These results surpass the performance of baseline models based solely on CNNs, LSTMs, or transformer-based classifiers such as BERT. The combination of neural network components enabled the model to effectively capture both fine-grained text structures and broader semantic context. Furthermore, the use of GloVe embeddings provided an efficient and effective representation of textual data, making the model suitable for integration into systems with real-time or near-real-time requirements. The proposed hybrid architecture demonstrates high effectiveness in text-based web content classification, particularly in tasks requiring both syntactic feature extraction and semantic interpretation. By combining presented mechanisms, the model addresses the limitations of individual architectures and achieves improved generalization. These findings support the broader use of hybrid deep learning approaches in NLP applications, especially where complex, unstructured textual data must be processed and classified with high reliability."}

By isolating lexical features (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF) and semantic embeddings (GloVe), we uncover a hard \"Performance Ceiling\", with fine-grained classification not exceeding a Weighted F1-score of 0.32 across models. Crucially, a simple linear SVM (Accuracy: 0.624) matches the performance of pre-trained Transformers such as RoBERTa (Accuracy: 0.620), suggesting that model capacity is not the primary bottleneck.

We compare the performance of neologism learning against low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, finding that neologisms outperform fine-tuned models under a matched training setup (same data and hyperparameters).

We create different dataset variants to study label standardization and PII representation, covering 24 standardized PII categories and higher-granularity settings. Evaluation using entity-level and character-level metrics, type accuracy, and exact match shows that both lightweight models achieve performance comparable to frontier LLMs for PII masking tasks. Label normalization consistently improves performance across architectures. Mistral achieves higher F1 and recall with greater robustness across PII types but incurs significantly higher generation latency. T5, while less robust in conversational text, offers more controllable structured outputs and lower inference cost, motivating its use in a real-time Discord bot for real-world PII redaction.

LLM-CAS trains an agent to learn a policy that dynamically selects temporary neuron perturbations during inference based on the current context. Unlike prior dynamic approaches that rely on heuristic or predefined adjustments, this policy driven mechanism enables adaptive and fine grained correction without permanent parameter modification.\n  Experiments across multiple language models demonstrate that LLM-CAS consistently improves factual accuracy, achieving gains of 10.98 percentage points on StoryCloze, 2.71 points on TriviaQA, and 2.06 points on the MC1 score of TruthfulQA.

This process is time-consuming and heavily reliant on expert knowledge. While large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating this task, existing approaches either suffer from poor formalization that fails to accurately align with the design intent or rely on solver feedback for data filtering, which is unavailable due to the high simulation costs. To address this challenge, we propose APF, a framework for solver-independent, automated problem formulation via LLMs designed to automatically convert engineers' natural language requirements into executable optimization models. The core of this framework is an innovative pipeline for automatically generating high-quality data, which overcomes the difficulty of constructing suitable fine-tuning datasets in the absence of high-cost solver feedback with the help of data generation and test instance annotation. The generated high-quality dataset is used to perform supervised fine-tuning on LLMs, significantly enhancing their ability to generate accurate and executable optimization problem formulations. Experimental results on antenna design demonstrate that APF significantly outperforms the existing methods in both the accuracy of requirement formalization and the quality of resulting radiation efficiency curves in meeting the design goals."}

Prior work has predominantly relied on manually engineered memory architectures to store trajectories, distill experience, and synthesize reusable tools, enabling agents to evolve on the fly within environment interactions. However, this paradigm is fundamentally constrained by the staticity of the memory system itself: while memory facilitates agent-level evolving, the underlying memory architecture cannot be meta-adapted to diverse task contexts. To address this gap, we propose MemEvolve, a meta-evolutionary framework that jointly evolves agents' experiential knowledge and their memory architecture, allowing agent systems not only to accumulate experience but also to progressively refine how they learn from it. To ground MemEvolve in prior research and foster openness in future self-evolving systems, we introduce EvolveLab, a unified self-evolving memory codebase that distills twelve representative memory systems into a modular design space (encode, store, retrieve, manage), providing both a standardized implementation substrate and a fair experimental arena. Extensive evaluations on four challenging agentic benchmarks demonstrate that MemEvolve achieves (I) substantial performance gains, improving frameworks such as SmolAgent and Flash-Searcher by up to $17.06\\%$; and (II) strong cross-task and cross-LLM generalization, designing memory architectures that transfer effectively across diverse benchmarks and backbone models."}

We formalize semantic channel finding-mapping natural-language intent to concrete control-system signals-as a general problem in complex experimental infrastructure, and introduce a four-paradigm framework to guide architecture selection across facility-specific data regimes. The paradigms span (i) direct in-context lookup over curated channel dictionaries, (ii) constrained hierarchical navigation through structured trees, (iii) interactive agent exploration using iterative reasoning and tool-based database queries, and (iv) ontology-grounded semantic search that decouples channel meaning from facility-specific naming conventions.

We study these questions in text-based environments, which provide a controlled setting to reinterpret language modeling as next-state prediction under interaction. We introduce a three-level framework for evaluating LLM-based world models: (i) fidelity and consistency, (ii) scalability and robustness, and (iii) agent utility. Across five representative environments, we find that sufficiently trained world models maintain coherent latent state, scale predictably with data and model size, and improve agent performance via action verification, synthetic trajectory generation, and warm-starting reinforcement learning.

Building on research in artificial intelligence and translation studies, it proposes a human-centered framework that conceptualizes artificial intelligence as a means of amplifying the terminologist's capabilities, rather than replacing them. The framework is organized around three interrelated dimensions: the augmented terminologist, ethical AI, and human-centered design. Together, these dimensions emphasize the compatibility of high automation with strong human control, the central role of terminologists in bias mitigation, and the importance of designing AI tools and workflows around the needs, values, and well-being of the terminologist.

In this work, we present a large-scale empirical analysis of Human-AI Difficulty Alignment for over 20 models across diverse domains such as medical knowledge and mathematical reasoning. Our findings reveal a systematic misalignment where scaling up model size is not reliably helpful; instead of aligning with humans, models converge toward a shared machine consensus. We observe that high performance often impedes accurate difficulty estimation, as models struggle to simulate the capability limitations of students even when being explicitly prompted to adopt specific proficiency levels. Furthermore, we identify a critical lack of introspection, as models fail to predict their own limitations.

We introduce FASTRIC, a Prompt Specification Language that makes implicit Finite State Machines (FSMs) explicit in natural language prompts, enabling conformance verification through execution trace analysis. The LLM serves as intelligent execution agent: interpreting designer-encoded FSMs to execute specified behavioral roles. Unlike symbolic specification languages requiring parsers and compilers, FASTRIC leverages LLMs as unified infrastructure-simultaneously parser, interpreter, runtime environment, and development assistant. FASTRIC guides designers to articulate seven FSM elements (Final States, Agents, States, Triggers, Roles, Initial State, Constraints) structuring multi-turn interactions. Specification formality-ranging from implicit descriptions that frontier models infer to explicit step-by-step instructions for weaker models-serves as a design parameter. We introduce procedural conformance as verification metric measuring execution adherence to FSM specifications. Testing a 3-state kindergarten tutoring FSM across four formality levels and three model scales (14.7B, 685B, 1T+ parameters) reveals optimal specification formality is a function of model capacity. DeepSeek-V3.2 (685B) achieves perfect conformance (1.00) at L2-L4; ChatGPT-5 (~1T) peaks at L3 (0.90) before collapsing at L4 (0.39); Phi4 (14.7B) shows no stable optimum with high variance (SD=0.16-0.36). These findings reveal model-specific formality ranges-\"Goldilocks zones\"-where specifications provide sufficient structure without over-constraint, establishing Prompt Specification Engineering for creating verifiable interaction protocols, transforming multi-turn interaction design from heuristic art to systematic engineering with measurable procedural guarantees."}

Most existing acceleration methods focus on traversing this generative trajectory more efficiently via improved solvers or sampling strategies. We advance a complementary perspective: shorten the trajectory itself by starting closer to the target distribution through context-aware initialization.\n  We propose a training-free interface that injects prompt-conditioned priors from a lightweight auxiliary model into the diffusion initialization, and instantiate it with two mechanisms: discrete token injection and representation-level embedding interpolation. Because injected priors can be imperfect and unmask-only decoding can over-commit early, we also introduce a simple confidence-based remasking mechanism as a form of prior skepticism. Preliminary evidence on GSM8K suggests that context-aware initialization can substantially reduce denoising iterations (about 35\\% fewer function evaluations in our setting), while also exposing a key open challenge: naive warm-starting can degrade final accuracy relative to strong diffusion baselines. We use these findings to motivate a research agenda around calibration, revision mechanisms, and representation alignment for reliable warm-started diffusion decoding."}

Most existing methods rely on embedding entities and relations into continuous geometric spaces and answer queries via differentiable set operations. While effective for simple query patterns, these approaches often struggle to generalize to complex queries involving multiple operators, deeper reasoning chains, or heterogeneous KG schemas. We propose ROG (Reasoning Over knowledge Graphs with large language models), an ensemble-style framework that combines query-aware KG neighborhood retrieval with large language model (LLM)-based chain-of-thought reasoning. ROG decomposes complex FOL queries into sequences of simpler sub-queries, retrieves compact, query-relevant subgraphs as contextual evidence, and performs step-by-step logical inference using an LLM, avoiding the need for task-specific embedding optimization. Experiments on standard KG reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ROG consistently outperforms strong embedding-based baselines in terms of mean reciprocal rank (MRR), with particularly notable gains on high-complexity query types. These results suggest that integrating structured KG retrieval with LLM-driven logical reasoning offers a robust and effective alternative for complex KG reasoning tasks."}

LDMs, operating on the product of these three instances (the document), model the discursive projection of a portion of human experience reified by the learning corpus. The proposed program aims to replace the ''fascination/fear'' dichotomy with public trials and procedures that make the place, uses, and limits of artificial discursive agents in contemporary social space decipherable, situating this approach within a perspective of governance and co-regulation involving the State, industry, civil society, and academia."}

Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on mathematical analysis of model weights and activations, SAP incorporates both the syntactic structure and attention patterns of sentences to guide the pruning process. By leveraging these linguistic features, SAP not only achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods but also enhances the interpretability of model behavior. To further improve robustness, we propose Candidate Filtering (CF), a mechanism that prioritizes heads based on their contribution to model performance, mitigating degradation during pruning. Experimental results indicate that SAP effectively preserves critical heads of a high density of strong attention values, outperforming existing head pruning strategies in retrain-free settings. These findings position SAP as a promising foundation for a new direction in model compression research, offering high flexibility for pruning across all transformer-based language models."}

Furthermore, natively combining reasoning and outcome rewards may yield suboptimal performance or conflict with the primary optimization objective. To address this, we propose advantage-weighted policy optimization (AWPO) -- a principled RL framework that effectively integrates explicit reasoning rewards to enhance tool-use capability. AWPO incorporates variance-aware gating and difficulty-aware weighting to adaptively modulate advantages from reasoning signals based on group-relative statistics, alongside a tailored clipping mechanism for stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AWPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard tool-use benchmarks, significantly outperforming strong baselines and leading closed-source models in challenging multi-turn scenarios.

However, existing methods rely on model-internal signals (e.g., logits, entropy), which are fundamentally unreliable because LLMs are typically ill-calibrated and often exhibit high confidence in erroneous outputs. We propose QuCo-RAG, which shifts from subjective confidence to objective statistics computed from pre-training data. Our method quantifies uncertainty through two stages: (1) before generation, we identify low-frequency entities indicating long-tail knowledge gaps; (2) during generation, we verify entity co-occurrence in the pre-training corpus, where zero co-occurrence often signals hallucination risk. Both stages leverage Infini-gram for millisecond-latency queries over 4 trillion tokens, triggering retrieval when uncertainty is high. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show QuCo-RAG achieves EM gains of 5--12 points over state-of-the-art baselines with OLMo-2 models, and transfers effectively to models with undisclosed pre-training data (Llama, Qwen, GPT), improving EM by up to 14 points. Domain generalization on biomedical QA further validates the robustness of our paradigm. These results establish corpus-grounded verification as a principled, practically model-agnostic paradigm for dynamic RAG. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ZhishanQ/QuCo-RAG."}

Modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, built upon Encoder-Decoder neural network architectures and trained on massive amounts of data, have progressively reduced transcription errors on standard benchmark datasets. However, their performance in real-world production environments, particularly for non-English content like long-form Italian videos, remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a case study on developing a professional subtitling system for an Italian media company. To inform our system design, we evaluated four state-of-the-art ASR models (Whisper Large v2, AssemblyAI Universal, Parakeet TDT v3 0.6b, and WhisperX) on a 50-hour dataset of Italian television programs. The study highlights their strengths and limitations, benchmarking their performance against the work of professional human subtitlers. The findings indicate that, while current models cannot meet the media industry's accuracy needs for full autonomy, they can serve as highly effective tools for enhancing human productivity.

We augment it with a separate action-taker model, Talker, to produce human-readable sentences.

We construct a consistent multi-task dataset, where each chart sample includes aligned annotations for schema prediction, data parsing, and question answering.

Furthermore, what social features of stigmas are associated with bias in LLM outputs is unknown. From psychology literature, it has been shown that stigmas contain six shared social features: aesthetics, concealability, course, disruptiveness, origin, and peril. In this study, we investigate if human and LLM ratings of the features of stigmas, along with prompt style and type of stigma, have effect on bias towards stigmatized groups in LLM outputs. We measure bias against 93 stigmatized groups across three widely used LLMs (Granite 3.0-8B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B) using SocialStigmaQA, a benchmark that includes 37 social scenarios about stigmatized identities; for example deciding wether to recommend them for an internship. We find that stigmas rated by humans to be highly perilous (e.g., being a gang member or having HIV) have the most biased outputs from SocialStigmaQA prompts (60% of outputs from all models) while sociodemographic stigmas (e.g. Asian-American or old age) have the least amount of biased outputs (11%). We test if the amount of biased outputs could be decreased by using guardrail models, models meant to identify harmful input, using each LLM's respective guardrail model (Granite Guardian 3.0, Llama Guard 3.0, Mistral Moderation API). We find that bias decreases significantly by 10.4%, 1.4%, and 7.8%, respectively. However, we show that features with significant effect on bias remain unchanged post-mitigation and that guardrail models often fail to recognize the intent of bias in prompts. This work has implications for using LLMs in scenarios involving stigmatized groups and we suggest future work towards improving guardrail models for bias mitigation."}

Current solutions face a fundamental dilemma. Training-based methods inject priors into parameters, but this static coupling hinders rapid knowledge updates and often compromises the model's general reasoning capabilities. Conversely, existing training-free methods avoid these issues but rely on surface-level prompting, failing to provide the fine-grained atom-level priors essential for precise chemical reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce ChemATP, a framework that decouples chemical knowledge from the reasoning engine. By constructing the first atom-level textual knowledge base, ChemATP enables frozen LLMs to explicitly retrieve and reason over this information dynamically. This architecture ensures interpretability and adaptability while preserving the LLM's intrinsic general intelligence. Experiments show that ChemATP significantly outperforms training-free baselines and rivals state-of-the-art training-based models, demonstrating that explicit prior injection is a competitive alternative to implicit parameter updates."}

Central to our approach is an LLM-based prompt optimizer agent that iteratively refines the prompts using retrieved examples, performance feedback, and internal self-evaluation. Our framework is evaluated on a real-world logistics text annotation task, where reasoning accuracy and labeling efficiency are critical. Experimental results show that the optimized prompts - particularly those enhanced via Auto-CoT and RAG - improve real-world inference accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline zero-shot or static prompts. The system demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple LLMs, including GPT-4o, Qwen 2.5 (72B), and LLaMA 3.1 (70B), validating its generalizability and practical value.

To systematically assess how the choice of LLM family, size, precision regime, and prompting strategy affect performance, we run a large factorial study in models, precisions, and prompt engineering techniques. An additional response parsing step nearly eliminates format errors while preserving accuracy; larger models deliver the strongest and most stable performance, while quantization offers substantial efficiency gains with modest accuracy trade-offs; and prompt strategies show heterogeneous, model-specific effects. CienaLLM matches or outperforms the supervised baseline in accuracy for extracting drought impacts from Spanish news, although at a higher inference cost.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MobileWorld, a substantially more challenging benchmark designed to better reflect real-world mobile usage, comprising 201 tasks across 20 applications, while maintaining the same level of reproducible evaluation as AndroidWorld. The difficulty of MobileWorld is twofold.

Second, MobileWorld extends beyond standard GUI manipulation by introducing novel task categories, including agent-user interaction and MCP-augmented tasks. To ensure robust evaluation, we provide snapshot-based container environment and precise functional verifications, including backend database inspection and task callback APIs. We further develop a planner-executor agentic framework with extended action spaces to support user interactions and MCP calls.

Evaluations on the SEA-HELM benchmark show that SiamGPT-32B achieves the strongest overall performance among similar-scale open-weights Thai models, with consistent gains in instruction following, multi-turn dialogue, and natural language understanding."}

While previous studies have focused on the output of large language models (LLMs) to improve scoring accuracy, we believe activations from intermediate layers may also provide valuable information. To explore this possibility, we evaluated the discriminative power of LLMs' activations in cross-prompt essay scoring task. Specifically, we used activations to fit probes and further analyzed the effects of different models and input content of LLMs on this discriminative power. By computing the directions of essays across various trait dimensions under different prompts, we analyzed the variation in evaluation perspectives of large language models concerning essay types and traits. Results show that the activations possess strong discriminative power in evaluating essay quality and that LLMs can adapt their evaluation perspectives to different traits and essay types, effectively handling the diversity of scoring criteria in cross-prompt settings."}

We present a fully automated framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to transform heterogeneous humanitarian documents into structured and evidence-grounded reports. The system integrates semantic text clustering, automatic question generation, retrieval augmented answer extraction with citations, multi-level summarization, and executive summary generation, supported by internal evaluation metrics that emulate expert reasoning. We evaluated the framework across 13 humanitarian events, including natural disasters and conflicts, using more than 1,100 documents from verified sources such as ReliefWeb. The generated questions achieved 84.7 percent relevance, 84.0 percent importance, and 76.4 percent urgency. The extracted answers reached 86.3 percent relevance, with citation precision and recall both exceeding 76 percent. Agreement between human and LLM based evaluations surpassed an F1 score of 0.80. Comparative analysis shows that the proposed framework produces reports that are more structured, interpretable, and actionable than existing baselines. By combining LLM reasoning with transparent citation linking and multi-level evaluation, this study demonstrates that generative AI can autonomously produce accurate, verifiable, and operationally useful humanitarian situation reports."}

Yet LLM based pipelines face deployment gaps, including hallucinations under weak constraints, fragile temporal and causal linking over long contexts and across documents, and limited long horizon knowledge management within a bounded context window. We argue that EE should be viewed as a system component that provides a cognitive scaffold for LLM centered solutions. Event schemas and slot constraints create interfaces for grounding and verification; event centric structures act as controlled intermediate representations for stepwise reasoning; event links support relation aware retrieval with graph based RAG; and event stores offer updatable episodic and agent memory beyond the context window. This survey covers EE in text and multimodal settings, organizing tasks and taxonomy, tracing method evolution from rule based and neural models to instruction driven and generative frameworks, and summarizing formulations, decoding strategies, architectures, representations, datasets, and evaluation. We also review cross lingual, low resource, and domain specific settings, and highlight open challenges and future directions for reliable event centric systems. Finally, we outline open challenges and future directions that are central to the LLM era, aiming to evolve EE from static extraction into a structurally reliable, agent ready perception and memory layer for open world systems."}

Early studies have begun to explore how the amount of compute in terms of the length of the reasoning process, the so-called thinking budget, impacts model performance. In this work, we propose a systematic investigation of the thinking budget as a key parameter, examining its interaction with various configurations such as self-consistency, reflection, and others. Our goal is to provide an informative, balanced comparison framework that considers both performance outcomes and computational cost. Among our findings, we discovered that simply increasing the thinking budget is not the most effective use of compute. More accurate responses can instead be achieved through alternative configurations, such as self-consistency and self-reflection."}

We continue HuBERT pre-training with supervision based on a phonetic-to-articulatory feature mapping in 55 languages. Our models learn from multilingual data to predict articulatory features or phones, resulting in language-independent representations that capture multilingual phonetic properties. Through comprehensive ABX discriminability testing, we show MauBERT models produce more context-invariant representations than state-of-the-art multilingual self-supervised learning models. Additionally, the models effectively adapt to unseen languages and casual speech with minimal self-supervised fine-tuning (10 hours of speech). This establishes an effective approach for instilling linguistic inductive biases in self-supervised speech models."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to automate this process, acting as judges to evaluate summaries with respect to the original text. While previous research investigated the alignment between LLMs and Human responses, it is not yet well understood what properties or features are exploited by them when asked to evaluate based on a particular quality dimension, and there has not been much attention towards mapping between evaluation scores and metrics. In this paper, we address this issue and discover features aligned with Human and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) responses by studying statistical and machine learning metrics. Furthermore, we show that instructing GPTs to employ metrics used by Human can improve their judgment and conforming them better with human responses."}

Our study focuses on two extremely under-resourced languages: Bribri, a Chibchan language spoken in Costa Rica, and Cook Islands Māori, a Polynesian language spoken in the Cook Islands. Specifically, this paper: (i) compares algorithms for diacritics restoration in under-resourced languages, including tonal diacritics, (ii) examines the amount of data required to achieve target performance levels, (iii) contrasts results across varying resource conditions, and (iv) explores the related task of diacritic correction. We find that fine-tuned, character-level LLMs perform best, likely due to their ability to decompose complex characters into their UTF-8 byte representations. In contrast, massively multilingual models perform less effectively given our data constraints. Across all models, reliable performance begins to emerge with data budgets of around 10,000 words. Zero-shot approaches perform poorly in all cases. This study responds both to requests from the language communities and to broader NLP research questions concerning model performance and generalization in under-resourced contexts."}

While supervised learning approaches dominate this field, the scarcity and high cost of annotated data for new domains present significant barriers. We argue that leveraging large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot setting is a practical alternative where resources for data annotation are limited. In this work, we propose a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique that utilises an intermediate Unified Meaning Representation (UMR) to structure the reasoning process for the ACSA task. We evaluate this UMR-based approach against a standard CoT baseline across three models (Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-8B, and Gemini-2.5-Pro) and four diverse datasets. Our findings suggest that UMR effectiveness may be model-dependent. Whilst preliminary results indicate comparable performance for mid-sized models such as Qwen3-8B, these observations warrant further investigation, particularly regarding the potential applicability to smaller model architectures. Further research is required to establish the generalisability of these findings across different model scales."}

We address this by introducing GenEnv, a framework that establishes a difficulty-aligned co-evolutionary game between an agent and a scalable, generative environment simulator. Unlike traditional methods that evolve models on static datasets, GenEnv instantiates a dataevolving: the simulator acts as a dynamic curriculum policy, continuously generating tasks specifically tailored to the agent's ``zone of proximal development''. This process is guided by a simple but effective $α$-Curriculum Reward, which aligns task difficulty with the agent's current capabilities. We evaluate GenEnv on five benchmarks, including API-Bank, ALFWorld, BFCL, Bamboogle, and TravelPlanner. Across these tasks, GenEnv improves agent performance by up to \\textbf{+40.3\\%} over 7B baselines and matches or exceeds the average performance of larger models. Compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro-based offline data augmentation, GenEnv achieves better performance while using 3.3$\\times$ less data. By shifting from static supervision to adaptive simulation, GenEnv provides a data-efficient pathway for scaling agent capabilities."}
