However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of\nsupervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer\nlearning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.\nThis paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,\nusing citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL\ncitations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we\ndevelop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models\n(LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and\napplications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.\nCross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based\nretrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that\naligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG\nassociations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping\npatents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression\nmodels. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1)\ninternal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method\noutperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot\nLLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation,\nco-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic,\ncognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological\nclassifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic\nalignment can enhance SDG classification at scale."}

Existing detection approaches,\nsuch as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not\naddress the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,\nwhere responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore\npresent MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time,\nunsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor\naccess to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes\ndomains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into\natomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using\nsynonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the\nretrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms\ncontradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a\nresponse-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG\nlocalizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g.,\npregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility),\nallowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure\nthresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a\nproprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for\ndetecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based\nconversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that\ntranslates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this\ndesign is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments."}

Existing methods either require expensive\ncomputational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical\nand unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a\nGenerative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and\nreliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in\nwhich the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden\nstate and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in\nreal-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with\ncalibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and\ntwo benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the\nbest discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks,\noutperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or\nan auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time\nscaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that\nusing GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also\nsignificantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling\nscheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying\nLLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation."}

We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines\ndense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to\nimprove both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that\nevaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data\nstratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions:\nlow, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables\na fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful\nsubspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG\nintegration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT\nmodels augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR\nregion, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings\nhighlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also\nthe importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model\nbehavior.

In this paper, on mental\nmath tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without\nexplicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting\ninput-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes\nof information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and\nforcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.\nWith two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and\nAttention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with\nhigh accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful\ncomputation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last\ntoken, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle\nlayers.
