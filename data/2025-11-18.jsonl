We introduce TimeStampEval, a benchmark for retrieving precise millisecond timestamps from long transcripts given non-verbatim quotes. Our simple two-stage method dramatically improves retrieval accuracy while cutting inference costs by over 90%. The motivating use case is an automated long-form podcast that assembles Congressional Record clips into AI-hosted narration. The technical challenge: given a sentence-timestamped transcript and a target quote that may differ due to transcription or editorial drift, return exact start and end boundaries. Standard algorithms handle verbatim text but break under fuzzier variants. Evaluating six modern LLMs on a 2,800-sentence (120k-token) transcript revealed four key findings. (1) Prompt design matters more than model choice: placing the query before the transcript and using compact formatting improved accuracy by 3-20 points while reducing token count by 30-40%. (2) Off-by-one errors form a distinct category, showing models understand the task but misplace boundaries. (3) A modest reasoning budget (600-850 tokens) raises accuracy from 37% to 77% for weak setups and to above 90% for strong ones. (4) Our \"Assisted Fuzzy\" approach-RapidFuzz pre-filtering followed by LLM verification on short snippets-improves fuzzy match accuracy by up to 50 points while halving latency and reducing cost per correct result by up to 96%. Extended tests on ten transcripts (50k-900k tokens, 1989-2025) confirm robustness to transcript length, vocabulary drift, and domain change, maintaining 95-100% rejection accuracy for absent targets."}

Unlike previous agents that only scale up model size or context length, MiroThinker explores interaction scaling at the model level, systematically training the model to handle deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions as a third dimension of performance improvement. Unlike LLM test-time scaling, which operates in isolation and risks degradation with longer reasoning chains, interactive scaling leverages environment feedback and external information acquisition to correct errors and refine trajectories. Through reinforcement learning, the model achieves efficient interaction scaling: with a 256K context window, it can perform up to 600 tool calls per task, enabling sustained multi-turn reasoning and complex real-world research workflows. Across four representative benchmarks-GAIA, HLE, BrowseComp, and BrowseComp-ZH-the 72B variant achieves up to 81.9%, 37.7%, 47.1%, and 55.6% accuracy respectively, surpassing previous open-source agents and approaching commercial counterparts such as GPT-5-high. Our analysis reveals that MiroThinker benefits from interactive scaling consistently: research performance improves predictably as the model engages in deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions, demonstrating that interaction depth exhibits scaling behaviors analogous to model size and context length. These findings establish interaction scaling as a third critical dimension for building next-generation open research agents, complementing model capacity and context windows."}

We assess definitions of reasoning and how key papers in the field of natural language processing (NLP) use the notion and argue that the definitions provided are not consistent with how LMs are trained, process information, and generate new tokens. To illustrate this incommensurability we assume the view that transformer-based LMs implement an \\textit{implicit} finite-order Markov kernel mapping contexts to conditional token distributions. In this view, reasoning-like outputs correspond to statistical regularities and approximate statistical invariances in the learned kernel rather than the implementation of explicit logical mechanisms. This view is illustrative of the claim that LMs are \"statistical pattern matchers\"\" and not genuine reasoners and provides a perspective that clarifies why reasoning-like outputs arise in LMs without any guarantees of logical consistency. This distinction is fundamental to how epistemic uncertainty is evaluated in LMs. We invite a discussion on the importance of how the computational processes of the systems we build and analyze in NLP research are described."}

While LLMs show promise in generating structured outputs from natural language (NL), such as Gherkin Scenarios from NL feature requirements, there's currently no formal method to verify if these outputs are accurate. This paper takes a preliminary step toward addressing this gap by exploring the use of a simple LLM-based autoformalizer to verify LLM-generated outputs against a small set of natural language requirements. We conducted two distinct experiments. In the first one, the autoformalizer successfully identified that two differently-worded NL requirements were logically equivalent, demonstrating the pipeline's potential for consistency checks. In the second, the autoformalizer was used to identify a logical inconsistency between a given NL requirement and an LLM-generated output, highlighting its utility as a formal verification tool. Our findings, while limited, suggest that autoformalization holds significant potential for ensuring the fidelity and logical consistency of LLM-generated outputs, laying a crucial foundation for future, more extensive studies into this novel application."}

The framework enables the extraction of high-level and low-level concepts conveyed through the narrative. Using dictionary-based sentiment analysis, our approach applies a custom lexicon built with the LabMTsimple storylab module.

Using this corpus, we systematically compared traditional machine-learning classifiers, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), Longformer, and a fully fine-tuned Llama3-8B-Instruct, with recent generative LLMs. To evaluate generative LLMs, we tested GPT-4o and the open-source GPT-OSS-20B under two configurations: a baseline (Base) and a task-optimized (Advanced) setting that focused inputs on metadata, recommendation sentences, and their surrounding context. A refined prompt for GPT-OSS-20B further improved reasoning accuracy.

CALM predicts outcomes as the additive sum of each component's contribution, making these contributions part of the forward computation itself and enabling faithful explanations at both the patient and population level. The additive structure also enables clear visualizations, such as component-level risk curves similar to those used in generalized additive models, making the learned relationships easier to inspect and communicate. Although CALM expects semi-structured inputs, many clinical documents already have this form, and similar structure can often be automatically extracted from free-text notes. CALM achieves performance comparable to conventional LLM classifiers while improving trust, supporting quality-assurance checks, and revealing clinically meaningful patterns during model development and auditing."}

Although recent tool-use benchmarks exist, they primarily target tool selection and simple execution rather than the compositional, multi-step reasoning needed for complex data analysis. To reduce this gap, we introduce Indirect Data Engagement (InData), a dataset designed to assess LLMs' multi-step tool-based reasoning ability. InData includes data analysis questions at three difficulty levels--Easy, Medium, and Hard--capturing increasing reasoning complexity. We benchmark 15 open-source LLMs on InData and find that while large models (e.g., gpt-oss-120b) achieve high accuracy on Easy tasks (97.3%), performance drops sharply on Hard tasks (69.6%). These results show that current LLMs still lack robust multi-step tool-based reasoning ability.

Past work found that models are miscalibrated, with entropy per step increasing (and text quality decreasing) as generations grow longer. This error accumulation is a fundamental problem in autoregressive models, and the standard solution is to truncate the distribution, which improves text quality at the cost of diversity. In this paper, we ask: is miscalibration likely to improve with scale, and is it theoretically possible to calibrate without tradeoffs? To build intuition, we first study a simplified theoretical setting to characterize the scaling behavior of miscalibration with respect to dataset size. We find that the scaling behavior depends on the power law exponent of the data distribution -- in particular, for a power law exponent close to 1, the scaling exponent is close to 0, meaning that miscalibration improves very slowly with scale. Next, we measure miscalibration empirically in language models ranging from 0.5B to 70B parameters. We find that the observed scaling behavior is similar to what is predicted by the simplified setting: our fitted scaling exponents for text are close to 0, meaning that larger models accumulate error at a similar rate as smaller ones. This scaling (or, lack thereof) provides one explanation for why we sample from larger models with similar amounts of truncation as smaller models, even though the larger models are of higher quality. However, truncation is not a satisfying solution because it comes at the cost of increased log loss. In theory, is it even possible to reduce entropy while preserving log loss? We prove that it is possible, if we assume access to a black box which can fit models to predict the future entropy of text."}

They excel at generating entities by semantic pattern matching but lack an explicit, verifiable reasoning mechanism. This \"cognitive shortcutting\" leads to suboptimal performance and brittle generalization, especially in zero-shot and lowresource scenarios where reasoning from limited contextual cues is crucial. To address this issue, a reasoning framework is proposed for NER, which shifts the extraction paradigm from implicit pattern matching to explicit reasoning. This framework consists of three stages: Chain of Thought (CoT) generation, CoT tuning, and reasoning enhancement. First, a dataset annotated with NER-oriented CoTs is generated, which contain task-relevant reasoning chains. Then, they are used to tune the NER model to generate coherent rationales before deriving the final answer. Finally, a reasoning enhancement stage is implemented to optimize the reasoning process using a comprehensive reward signal. This stage ensures explicit and verifiable extractions. Experiments show that ReasoningNER demonstrates impressive cognitive ability in the NER task, achieving competitive performance. In zero-shot settings, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming GPT-4 by 12.3 percentage points on the F1 score. Analytical results also demonstrate its great potential to advance research in reasoningoriented information extraction. Our codes are available at https://github.com/HuiResearch/ReasoningIE."}

Specifically, we analyze reasoning errors in vision language models (VLMs) and how they impact user trust and the ability to detect errors. Our findings reveal two key effects: (1) users often equate trust with outcome agreement, sustaining reliance even when reasoning is flawed, and (2) the confident tone suppresses error detection while maintaining reliance, showing that delivery styles can override correctness. These results highlight how CoT explanations can simultaneously clarify and mislead, underscoring the need for NLP systems to provide explanations that encourage scrutiny and critical thinking rather than blind trust.

In addition to the standard Exact Match metric, we introduce four complementary metrics (Coverage, Specificity, Connotation, and Coherence) to capture different dimensions of model's response quality. Empirical analysis across frontier models reveals that thin evaluation systematically overestimates cultural competence and produces unstable assessments with high variance. In contrast, thick evaluation exposes differences in reasoning depth, reduces variance, and provides more stable, interpretable signals of cultural understanding."}

Experiments on U-MStance demonstrate that PRISM yields significant gains over strong baselines, underscoring the effectiveness of user-centric and context-grounded multimodal reasoning for realistic stance understanding."}

A lack of task-specific data often limits previous works, and direct LLM application suffers from strategic brittleness and factual hallucination. In this paper, we first construct and release TeleSalesCorpus, the first real-world-grounded dialogue dataset for this domain. We then propose AI-Salesman, a novel framework featuring a dual-stage architecture. For the training stage, we design a Bayesian-supervised reinforcement learning algorithm that learns robust sales strategies from noisy dialogues. For the inference stage, we introduce the Dynamic Outline-Guided Agent (DOGA), which leverages a pre-built script library to provide dynamic, turn-by-turn strategic guidance. Moreover, we design a comprehensive evaluation framework that combines fine-grained metrics for key sales skills with the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed AI-Salesman significantly outperforms baseline models in both automatic metrics and comprehensive human evaluations, showcasing its effectiveness in complex persuasive scenarios."}

This reference-free framework not only effectively handles rich-context scenarios, but also offers interpretability. To facilitate this, an innovative pipeline is accordingly designed for generating instruction-tuning data (R-Instruct), featuring rich-context descriptions, grounding masks, and hard negative samples. We further establish R^2 -HalBench, a new hallucination benchmark for MLLMs, which, unlike previous benchmarks, encompasses real-world, rich-context descriptions from 18 MLLMs with high-quality annotations, spanning diverse object-, attribute, and relationship-level details. VBackChecker outperforms prior complex frameworks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on R^2 -HalBench, even rivaling GPT-4o's capabilities in hallucination detection.

This poses serious risks in domains like healthcare, finance, and customer support. A typical way to use LLMs is via the APIs provided by LLM vendors where there is no access to model weights or options to fine-tune the model. Existing methods to detect hallucinations in such settings where the model access is restricted or constrained by resources typically require making multiple LLM API calls, increasing latency and API cost. We introduce CONFACTCHECK, an efficient hallucination detection approach that does not leverage any external knowledge base and works on the simple intuition that responses to factual probes within the generated text should be consistent within a single LLM and across different LLMs. Rigorous empirical evaluation on multiple datasets that cover both the generation of factual texts and the open generation shows that CONFACTCHECK can detect hallucinated facts efficiently using fewer resources and achieves higher accuracy scores compared to existing baselines that operate under similar conditions.

Since the abstractive summaries of legal documents generated by deep neural methods remain prone to the risk of misrepresenting nuanced legal jargon or overlooking key contextual details, we envisage a rising trend toward the use of extractive case summarizers.\n  Given the high cost of human annotation for gold standard extractive summaries, we engineer a light and transparent pipeline that leverages existing abstractive gold standard summaries to create the corresponding extractive gold standard versions. The approach ensures that the experts` opinions ensconced in the original gold standard abstractive summaries are carried over to the transformed extractive summaries. We aim to augment seven existing case summarization datasets, which include abstractive summaries, by incorporating corresponding extractive summaries and create an enriched data resource for case summarization research community. To ensure the quality of the augmented extractive summaries, we perform an extensive comparative evaluation with the original abstractive gold standard summaries covering structural, lexical, and semantic dimensions. We also compare the domain-level information of the two summaries. We commit to release the augmented datasets in the public domain for use by the research community and believe that the resource will offer opportunities to advance the field of automatic summarization of legal documents."}

Large language models (LLMs) face the same challenge: suppressing a concept requires internally activating it, which may prime rebound instead of avoidance. We investigated this tension with two experiments. \\textbf{(1) Load \\& content}: after a negation instruction, we vary distractor text (semantic, syntactic, repetition) and measure rebound strength. \\textbf{(2) Polarity separation}: We test whether models distinguish neutral from negative framings of the same concept and whether this separation predicts rebound persistence. Results show that rebound consistently arises immediately after negation and intensifies with longer or semantic distractors, while repetition supports suppression. Stronger polarity separation correlates with more persistent rebound. Together, these findings, complemented by a circuit tracing analysis that identifies sparse middle-layer attention heads amplifying forbidden tokens while early layers suppress, link cognitive predictions of ironic rebound with mechanistic insights into long-context interference. To support future work, we release ReboundBench, a dataset of $5,000$ systematically varied negation prompts designed to probe rebound in LLMs."}

To address this gap, we introduce ILAKKANAM, the first Tamil-specific linguistic evaluation benchmark manually curated using 820 questions from Sri Lankan school-level Tamil subject examination papers. Each question is annotated by trained linguists under five linguistic categories and a factual knowledge category, spanning Grades 1--13 to ensure broad linguistic coverage.

Our results show that Gemini 2.5 achieves the highest overall performance, while open-source models lag behind, highlighting the gap in linguistic grounding. Category- and grade-wise analyses reveal that all models perform well on lower-grade questions but show a clear decline as linguistic complexity increases. Further, no strong correlation is observed between a model's overall performance and its ability to identify linguistic categories, suggesting that performance may be driven by exposure rather than genuine understanding."}

We design it to favor and encourage reward models that better capture preferences across different dimensions. Furthermore, we introduce an analysis method, inference-time probing, which identifies the dimensions used during the reward prediction and enhances its interpretability.

We propose a causal framework for analyzing and mitigating length bias in RLHF reward modeling. Central to our approach is a counterfactual data augmentation method that generates response pairs designed to isolate content quality from verbosity. These counterfactual examples are then used to train the reward model, enabling it to assess responses based on content quality independently of verbosity. Specifically, we construct (1) length-divergent pairs with similar content and (2) content-divergent pairs of similar length. Empirical evaluations show that our method reduces length bias in reward assignment and leads to more concise, content-focused outputs from the policy model. These findings demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively reduces length bias and improves the robustness and content sensitivity of reward modeling in RLHF pipelines."}

Extensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves SOTA or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (reducing WER by 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics."}

We find that SFT-based methods, e.g., Reason-KE, while state-of-the-art, suffer from a \"faithfulness gap\": they optimize for format mimicry rather than sound reasoning. This gap enables the LLM's powerful parametric priors to override new contextual facts, resulting in critical factual hallucinations (e.g., incorrectly reasoning \"Houston\" from \"NASA\" despite an explicit edit). To solve this core LLM alignment problem, we propose Reason-KE++, an SFT+RL framework that instills process-level faithfulness. Its core is a Stage-aware Reward mechanism that provides dense supervision for intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., Decomposition, Sub-answer Correctness). Crucially, we identify that naive outcome-only RL is a deceptive trap for LLM alignment: it collapses reasoning integrity (e.g., 19.00% Hop acc) while superficially boosting final accuracy. Our process-aware framework sets a new SOTA of 95.48% on MQUAKE-CF-3k (+5.28%), demonstrating that for complex tasks, aligning the reasoning process is essential for building trustworthy LLMs."}

However, direct S2ST models require large amounts of parallel speech data in the source and target languages, which are rarely available for low-resource languages such as Persian. This paper presents a direct S2ST system for translating Persian speech into English speech, as well as a pipeline for synthetic parallel Persian-English speech generation. The model comprises three components: (1) a conformer-based encoder, initialized from self-supervised pre-training, maps source speech to high-level acoustic representations; (2) a causal transformer decoder with relative position multi-head attention translates these representations into discrete target speech units; (3) a unit-based neural vocoder generates waveforms from the predicted discrete units. To mitigate the data scarcity problem, we construct a new Persian-English parallel speech corpus by translating Persian speech transcriptions into English using a large language model and then synthesizing the corresponding English speech with a state-of-the-art zero-shot text-to-speech system. The resulting corpus increases the amount of available parallel speech by roughly a factor of six. On the Persian-English portion of the CVSS corpus, the proposed model achieves improvement of 4.6 ASR BLEU with the synthetic data over direct baselines. These results indicate that combining self-supervised pre-training, discrete speech units, and synthetic parallel data is effective for improving direct S2ST in low-resource language pairs such as Persian-English"}

Instead of refining prompts, EvoSynth employs a multi-agent system to autonomously engineer, evolve, and execute novel, code-based attack algorithms. Crucially, it features a code-level self-correction loop, allowing it to iteratively rewrite its own attack logic in response to failure. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that EvoSynth not only establishes a new state-of-the-art by achieving an 85.5\\% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against highly robust models like Claude-Sonnet-4.5, but also generates attacks that are significantly more diverse than those from existing methods.

AFM packs messages chronologically under a strict token budget, preferring high fidelity for the most relevant turns while aiming to preserve a cheap trace of the dialogue. In a safety-oriented benchmark involving a user with a severe peanut allergy planning a trip to Thailand, AFM retains the allergy across both short and medium-length conversations, matches the safety performance of naive replay, and cuts average token usage by 66% relative to a replay baseline.

We focus on set membership queries -- among the most fundamental forms of reasoning -- using tasks like ``Is apple an element of the set \\{pear, plum, apple, raspberry\\}?''. We conduct a systematic empirical evaluation across prompt phrasing, semantic structure, element ordering, and model choice. Our large-scale analysis reveals that LLM performance on this elementary task is consistently brittle, and unpredictable across all dimensions, suggesting that the models' ``understanding'' of the set concept is fragmented and convoluted at best. Our work demonstrates that the large-scale experiments enabled by the simplicity of the problem allow us to map and analyze the failure modes comprehensively, making this approach a valuable methodology for LLM evaluation in general."}

Prior work, such as that of Wei et al., demonstrated these phenomena under model and data scaling, with transitions revealed after applying a log scale to training compute. In this work, we ask three complementary questions: (1) Are phase transitions unique to large models, or can they also be observed in small transformer-based language models? (2) Can such transitions be detected directly in linear training space, rather than only after log rescaling? and (3) Can these transitions emerge at early stages of training? To investigate, we train a small GPT-style transformer on a character-level corpus and analyze the evolution of vocabulary usage throughout training. We track the average word length, the number of correct versus incorrect words, and shifts in vocabulary diversity. Building on these measures, we apply Poisson and sub-Poisson statistics to quantify how words connect and reorganize. This combined analysis reveals a distinct transition point during training. Notably, these transitions are not apparent in standard loss or validation curves, but become visible through our vocabulary- and statistics-based probes. Our findings suggest that phase-transition reorganizations are a general feature of language model training, observable even in modest models, detectable directly in linear training space, and occurring surprisingly early as coherence emerges. This perspective provides new insight into the nonlinear dynamics of language model training and underscores the importance of tailored metrics for uncovering phase transition behaviors"}

In this paper, we investigate this claim in the autoformalization domain. Specifically, we evaluate the robustness of LLMs generating formal proofs with semantically similar paraphrased NL statements by measuring semantic and compilation validity. Using the formal benchmarks MiniF2F (Zheng, Han, and Polu 2021) and Lean 4 version of ProofNet (Xin et al. 2024), and two modern LLMs, we generate paraphrased natural language statements and cross-evaluate these statements across both models.

We first employ attribution patching to identify causally influential components, to find a key intervention locus by observing activation patterns during diagnostic conversational tasks. We then derive emotional expression vectors from the difference in the activations generated by contrastive text pairs (positive vs. negative examples of target emotions).

This instability affects replicability, reliability, and interpretation, raising concerns about whether topic models capture meaningful topics or just noise.

These generated corpora are run through LDA 50 times to determine the variability in the output. We show that LDA can correctly determine the underlying number of topics in the documents.

Building on this, we propose Honesty-Critical Neurons Restoration (HCNR) to surgically repair this suppressed capacity. HCNR identifies and restores key expression-governing neurons to their pre-trained state while harmonizing them with task-oriented neurons via Hessian-guided compensation.

But is this victory complete? Are the multilingual models better than aligned monolingual models in every aspect? Can the higher computational cost of multilingual models always be justified? Or is there a compromise between the two extremes? Bilingual Lexicon Induction is one of the most widely used metrics in terms of evaluating the degree of alignment between two embedding spaces. In this study, we explore the strengths and limitations of BLI as a measure to evaluate the degree of alignment of two embedding spaces. Further, we evaluate how well traditional embedding alignment techniques, novel multilingual models, and combined alignment techniques perform BLI tasks in the contexts of both high-resource and low-resource languages. In addition to that, we investigate the impact of the language families to which the pairs of languages belong. We identify that BLI does not measure the true degree of alignment in some cases and we propose solutions for them. We propose a novel stem-based BLI approach to evaluate two aligned embedding spaces that take into account the inflected nature of languages as opposed to the prevalent word-based BLI techniques. Further, we introduce a vocabulary pruning technique that is more informative in showing the degree of the alignment, especially performing BLI on multilingual embedding models. Often, combined embedding alignment techniques perform better while in certain cases multilingual embeddings perform better (mainly low-resource language cases)."}

To address this issue, we introduce Spark-Prover-X1, a 7B parameter model trained via an three-stage framework designed to unlock the reasoning potential of more accessible and moderately-sized LLMs. The first stage infuses deep knowledge through continuous pre-training on a broad mathematical corpus, enhanced by a suite of novel data tasks. Key innovation is a \"CoT-augmented state prediction\" task to achieve fine-grained reasoning. The second stage employs Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) within an expert iteration loop to specialize both the Spark-Prover-X1-7B and Spark-Formalizer-X1-7B models. Finally, a targeted round of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied to sharpen the prover's capabilities on the most challenging problems. To facilitate robust evaluation, particularly on problems from real-world examinations, we also introduce ExamFormal-Bench, a new benchmark dataset of 402 formal problems. Experimental results demonstrate that Spark-Prover-X1-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among similarly-sized open-source models, attaining a 37.0\\% average pass rate (pass@32).

This study aimed to systematically evaluate the accuracy and reliability of contemporary LLMs in identifying the adherence of published RCTs to the CONSORT 2010 statement under a zero-shot setting. We constructed a golden standard dataset of 150 published RCTs spanning diverse medical specialties. The primary outcome was the macro-averaged F1-score for the three-class classification task, supplemented by item-wise performance metrics and qualitative error analysis. Overall model performance was modest. The top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Flash and DeepSeek-R1, achieved nearly identical macro F1 scores of 0.634 and Cohen's Kappa coefficients of 0.280 and 0.282, respectively, indicating only fair agreement with expert consensus. A striking performance disparity was observed across classes: while most models could identify compliant items with high accuracy (F1 score > 0.850), they struggled profoundly with identifying non-compliant and not applicable items, where F1 scores rarely exceeded 0.400. Notably, some high-profile models like GPT-4o underperformed, achieving a macro F1-score of only 0.521. LLMs show potential as preliminary screening assistants for CONSORT checks, capably identifying well-reported items. However, their current inability to reliably detect reporting omissions or methodological flaws makes them unsuitable for replacing human expertise in the critical appraisal of trial quality."}

AEC decomposes ZSEE into specialized subtasks--retrieval, planning, coding, and verification--each handled by a dedicated LLM agent. Event schemas are represented as executable class definitions, enabling deterministic validation and precise feedback via a verification agent. This programming-inspired approach allows for systematic disambiguation and schema enforcement through iterative refinement.

During training, we employ LLM-generated predictions on unlabeled data by using grammar competency rubric-based prompts. These predictions, treated as pseudo labels, are utilized to train a transformer-based model through a novel training framework designed to handle label noise effectively. We show that the choice of LLM for pseudo-label generation critically affects model performance and that the ratio of clean-to-noisy samples during training strongly influences stability and accuracy. Finally, a qualitative analysis of error intensity and score prediction confirms the robustness and interpretability of our approach.

TCM-5CEval is designed to assess LLMs across five critical dimensions: (1) Core Knowledge (TCM-Exam), (2) Classical Literacy (TCM-LitQA), (3) Clinical Decision-making (TCM-MRCD), (4) Chinese Materia Medica (TCM-CMM), and (5) Clinical Non-pharmacological Therapy (TCM-ClinNPT).

TCM-5CEval not only provides a more detailed diagnostic tool for LLM capabilities in TCM but aldso exposes fundamental weaknesses in their reasoning stability.

Today, many translators exist, based on encoder-decoder deep architectures, nevertheless, no quantitative objective methods are available to assess their performance, likely because the entropy of even a single language remains unknown. This study presents a quantitative method for estimating translation entropy, with the following key finding. Given a translator, several sentences that differ by only one selected token of a given pivot sentence yield identical translations. Analyzing the statistics of this phenomenon across an ensemble of such sentences, consisting each of a pivot selected token, yields the probabilities of replacing this specific token with others while preserving the translation. These probabilities constitute the entropy of the selected token, and the average across all selected pivot tokens provides an estimate of the translator's overall translation entropy, which is enhanced along the decoder blocks. This entropic measure allows for the quantitative ranking of several publicly available translators and reveals whether mutual translation entropy is symmetric. Extending the proposed method to include the replacement of two tokens in a given pivot sentence demonstrates a multiplicative effect, where translation degeneracy is proportional to the product of the degeneracies of the two tokens. These findings establish translation entropy as a measurable property and objective benchmarking of artificial translators. Results are based on MarianMT, T5-Base and NLLB-200 translators."}

In this paper, we introduce Soup Of Category Experts (SoCE), a principled approach for model souping that utilizes benchmark composition to identify optimal model candidates and applies non-uniform weighted averaging to maximize performance. Contrary to previous uniform-averaging approaches, our method leverages the observation that benchmark categories often exhibit low inter-correlations in model performance. SoCE identifies \"expert\" models for each weakly-correlated category cluster and combines them using optimized weighted averaging rather than uniform weights.

However, current watermarking methods often resist only a subset of attacks and fail to provide \\textit{comprehensive} protection. To this end, we present the region-triggered semantic watermarking framework called RegionMarker, which defines trigger regions within a low-dimensional space and injects watermarks into text embeddings associated with these regions. By utilizing a secret dimensionality reduction matrix to project onto this subspace and randomly selecting trigger regions, RegionMarker makes it difficult for watermark removal attacks to evade detection. Furthermore, by embedding watermarks across the entire trigger region and using the text embedding as the watermark, RegionMarker is resilient to both paraphrasing and dimension-perturbation attacks. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that RegionMarker is effective in resisting different attack methods, thereby protecting the copyright of EaaS."}

We developed PEDIASBench, a systematic evaluation framework centered on a knowledge-system framework and tailored to realistic clinical environments. PEDIASBench assesses LLMs across three dimensions: application of basic knowledge, dynamic diagnosis and treatment capability, and pediatric medical safety and medical ethics. We evaluated 12 representative models released over the past two years, including GPT-4o, Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-V3, covering 19 pediatric subspecialties and 211 prototypical diseases. State-of-the-art models performed well on foundational knowledge, with Qwen3-235B-A22B achieving over 90% accuracy on licensing-level questions, but performance declined ~15% as task complexity increased, revealing limitations in complex reasoning. Multiple-choice assessments highlighted weaknesses in integrative reasoning and knowledge recall. In dynamic diagnosis and treatment scenarios, DeepSeek-R1 scored highest in case reasoning (mean 0.58), yet most models struggled to adapt to real-time patient changes. On pediatric medical ethics and safety tasks, Qwen2.5-72B performed best (accuracy 92.05%), though humanistic sensitivity remained limited. These findings indicate that pediatric LLMs are constrained by limited dynamic decision-making and underdeveloped humanistic care. Future development should focus on multimodal integration and a clinical feedback-model iteration loop to enhance safety, interpretability, and human-AI collaboration. While current LLMs cannot independently perform pediatric care, they hold promise for decision support, medical education, and patient communication, laying the groundwork for a safe, trustworthy, and collaborative intelligent pediatric healthcare system."}

However, linear extrapolation biases judgment on samples of different sizes, over-penalizing short samples and under-penalizing long ones, producing misalignment with expert intuition.\n  Building on the Multi-Range framework, this paper presents a calibrated, non-linear scoring model that better reflects how human content consumers perceive translation quality across samples of varying length. Empirical data from three large-scale enterprise environments shows that acceptable error counts grow logarithmically, not linearly, with sample size.\n  Psychophysical and cognitive evidence, including the Weber-Fechner law and Cognitive Load Theory, supports this premise by explaining why the perceptual impact of additional errors diminishes while the cognitive burden grows with scale. We propose a two-parameter model\n  E(x) = a * ln(1 + b * x), a, b > 0,\n  anchored to a reference tolerance and calibrated from two tolerance points using a one-dimensional root-finding step. The model yields an explicit interval within which the linear approximation stays within +/-20 percent relative error and integrates into existing evaluation workflows with only a dynamic tolerance function added.\n  The approach improves interpretability, fairness, and inter-rater reliability across both human and AI-generated translations. By operationalizing a perceptually valid scoring paradigm, it advances translation quality evaluation toward more accurate and scalable assessment. The model also provides a stronger basis for AI-based document-level evaluation aligned with human judgment.

In this work, we propose a novel computational framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the qualitative annotation of public narratives. Using a codebook we co-developed with subject-matter experts, we evaluate LLM performance against that of expert annotators. Our work reveals that LLMs can achieve near-human-expert performance, achieving an average F1 score of 0.80 across 8 narratives and 14 codes. We then extend our analysis to empirically explore how PN framework elements manifest across a larger dataset of 22 stories. Lastly, we extrapolate our analysis to a set of political speeches, establishing a novel lens in which to analyze political rhetoric in civic spaces. This study demonstrates the potential of LLM-assisted annotation for scalable narrative analysis and highlights key limitations and directions for future research in computational civic storytelling."}

To address this gap, we introduce two new datasets -- BEA-Large and BEA-Dialogue -- constructed from the previously unprocessed portions of the Hungarian speech corpus named BEA. BEA-Large extends BEA-Base with 255 hours of spontaneous speech from 433 speakers, enriched with detailed segment-level metadata. BEA-Dialogue, comprising 85 hours of spontaneous conversations, is a Hungarian speech corpus featuring natural dialogues partitioned into speaker-independent subsets, supporting research in conversational ASR and speaker diarization. We establish reproducible baselines on these datasets using publicly available ASR models, with the fine-tuned Fast Conformer model achieving word error rates as low as 14.18\\% on spontaneous and 4.8\\% on repeated speech. Diarization experiments yield diarization error rates between 13.05\\% and 18.26\\%, providing reference points for future improvements. The results highlight the persistent difficulty of conversational ASR, particularly due to disfluencies, overlaps, and informal speech patterns. By releasing these datasets and baselines, we aim to advance Hungarian speech technology and offer a methodological framework for developing spontaneous and conversational benchmarks in other languages."}

To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy for text-to-SQL classification based on dimensions including core intents, statement types, syntax structures, and key actions. Using this taxonomy, we evaluate widely used public text-to-SQL datasets (e.g., Spider and Bird) and reveal limitations in their coverage and diversity. We then introduce a taxonomy-guided dataset synthesis pipeline, yielding a new dataset named SQL-Synth. This approach combines the taxonomy with Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure the dataset reflects the breadth and complexity of real-world text-to-SQL applications. Extensive analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness of our taxonomy, as SQL-Synth exhibits greater diversity and coverage compared to existing benchmarks. Moreover, we uncover that existing LLMs typically fall short in adequately capturing the full range of scenarios, resulting in limited performance on SQL-Synth. However, fine-tuning can substantially improve their performance in these scenarios. The proposed taxonomy has significant potential impact, as it not only enables comprehensive analysis of datasets and the performance of different LLMs, but also guides the construction of training data for LLMs."}

Existing memory systems often depend on semantic grouping prior to retrieval, which can overlook semantically irrelevant yet critical user information and introduce retrieval noise. In this report, we propose the initial design of O-Mem, a novel memory framework based on active user profiling that dynamically extracts and updates user characteristics and event records from their proactive interactions with agents. O-Mem supports hierarchical retrieval of persona attributes and topic-related context, enabling more adaptive and coherent personalized responses. O-Mem achieves 51.76% on the public LoCoMo benchmark, a nearly 3% improvement upon LangMem,the previous state-of-the-art, and it achieves 62.99% on PERSONAMEM, a 3.5% improvement upon A-Mem,the previous state-of-the-art. O-Mem also boosts token and interaction response time efficiency compared to previous memory frameworks. Our work opens up promising directions for developing efficient and human-like personalized AI assistants in the future."}

Using LLMs to Discover Language Phenomena from Lexical Cues", "comment": null, "summary": "Deceptive reviews mislead consumers, harm businesses, and undermine trust in online marketplaces. Machine learning classifiers can learn from large amounts of training examples to effectively distinguish deceptive reviews from genuine ones. However, the distinguishing features learned by these classifiers are often subtle, fragmented, and difficult for humans to interpret. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLMs) to translate machine-learned lexical cues into human-understandable language phenomena that can differentiate deceptive reviews from genuine ones. We show that language phenomena obtained in this manner are empirically grounded in data, generalizable across similar domains, and more predictive than phenomena either in LLMs' prior knowledge or obtained through in-context learning. These language phenomena have the potential to aid people in critically assessing the credibility of online reviews in environments where deception detection classifiers are unavailable."}

However, its layered meanings, cultural allusions, and sophisticated grammatical constructions often pose challenges for comprehension, especially for non-native speakers or readers unfamiliar with its context and language. Despite its cultural significance, existing works on poetry have largely overlooked Indian language poems. In this paper, we propose the Translation and Image Generation (TAI) framework, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Latent Diffusion Models through appropriate prompt tuning. Our framework supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education (SDG 4) and Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) by enhancing the accessibility of culturally rich Indian-language poetry to a global audience. It includes (1) a translation module that uses an Odds Ratio Preference Alignment Algorithm to accurately translate morphologically rich poetry into English, and (2) an image generation module that employs a semantic graph to capture tokens, dependencies, and semantic relationships between metaphors and their meanings, to create visually meaningful representations of Indian poems. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, including both human and quantitative assessments, demonstrates the superiority of TAI Diffusion in poem image generation tasks, outperforming strong baselines. To further address the scarcity of resources for Indian-language poetry, we introduce the Morphologically Rich Indian Language Poems MorphoVerse Dataset, comprising 1,570 poems across 21 low-resource Indian languages. By addressing the gap in poetry translation and visual comprehension, this work aims to broaden accessibility and enrich the reader's experience."}

Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions. We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet. To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception. After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively. We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks. Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system. Our findings suggest that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on EHR. Our findings support the emerging view that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, and show that effective healthcare systems AI requires the combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning, and real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks."}
