However, a persistent and\nsubstantial gap remains between algorithm design and hardware implementation.\nBridging this gap traditionally requires extensive domain expertise and\ntime-consuming manual development, due to fundamental mismatches between\nhigh-level programming languages like MATLAB and hardware description languages\n(HDLs) such as Verilog-in terms of memory access patterns, data processing\nmanners, and datatype representations. To address this challenge, we propose\nA2HCoder: a Hierarchical Algorithm-to-HDL Coding Agent, powered by large\nlanguage models (LLMs), designed to enable agile and reliable\nalgorithm-to-hardware translation. A2HCoder introduces a hierarchical framework\nthat enhances both robustness and interpretability while suppressing common\nhallucination issues in LLM-generated code. In the horizontal dimension,\nA2HCoder decomposes complex algorithms into modular functional blocks,\nsimplifying code generation and improving consistency. In the vertical\ndimension, instead of relying on end-to-end generation, A2HCoder performs\nstep-by-step, fine-grained translation, leveraging external toolchains such as\nMATLAB and Vitis HLS for debugging and circuit-level synthesis. This structured\nprocess significantly mitigates hallucinations and ensures hardware-level\ncorrectness. We validate A2HCoder through a real-world deployment case in the\n5G wireless communication domain, demonstrating its practicality, reliability,\nand deployment efficiency."}

Traditional\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods primarily focus on coarse-grained\ntextual semantic similarity and ignore structural associations among dispersed\nknowledge, which limits their effectiveness in MHQA tasks. GraphRAG methods\naddress this by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture structural\nassociations, but they tend to overly rely on structural information and\nfine-grained word- or phrase-level retrieval, resulting in an underutilization\nof textual semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG approach called\nHGRAG for MHQA that achieves cross-granularity integration of structural and\nsemantic information via hypergraphs. Structurally, we construct an entity\nhypergraph where fine-grained entities serve as nodes and coarse-grained\npassages as hyperedges, and establish knowledge association through shared\nentities. Semantically, we design a hypergraph retrieval method that integrates\nfine-grained entity similarity and coarse-grained passage similarity via\nhypergraph diffusion. Finally, we employ a retrieval enhancement module, which\nfurther refines the retrieved results both semantically and structurally, to\nobtain the most relevant passages as context for answer generation with the\nLLM.

This study therefore investigates how the content and format of such\nsupplementary information affect sentiment analysis using LLMs. We compare\nnatural language (NL) and JSON-formatted prompts using a lightweight 3B\nparameter model suitable for practical marketing applications. Experiments on\ntwo Yelp categories (Restaurant and Nightlife) show that the JSON prompt with\nadditional information outperforms all baselines without fine-tuning: Macro-F1\nrises by 1.6% and 4% while RMSE falls by 16% and 9.1%, respectively, making it\ndeployable in resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, a follow-up\nanalysis confirms that performance gains stem from genuine contextual reasoning\nrather than label proxying. This work demonstrates that structured prompting\ncan enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance, offering a\npractical alternative to large-scale model deployment."}

Building on research on fairness and\ndiscrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias --\ndiscrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human\nanimals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)\nSpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral\nevaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures\ncomparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation\ntasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In\nour benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely\ncondemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On\npsychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower\nexplicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose\nto save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that\nLLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities\nwere equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described\nas more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In\nopen-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized\nharm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.\nThese findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and\nmainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms\naround animal exploitation. We argue that expanding AI fairness and alignment\nframeworks to explicitly include non-human moral patients is essential for\nreducing these biases and preventing the entrenchment of speciesist attitudes\nin AI systems and the societies they influence."}

As the same problem arises in today's language models (LMs), we\ninvestigate the relationship between LM--brain alignment and two neural\nmetrics: (1) the level of brain activation during processing of sentences,\ntargeting linguistic processing, and (2) a novel measure of meaning consistency\nacross input modalities, which quantifies how consistently a brain region\nresponds to the same concept across paradigms (sentence, word cloud, image)\nusing an fMRI dataset (Pereira et al., 2018). Our experiments show that both\nlanguage-only and language-vision models predict the signal better in more\nmeaning-consistent areas of the brain, even when these areas are not strongly\nsensitive to language processing, suggesting that LMs might internally\nrepresent cross-modal conceptual meaning."}

Recent advances in artificial intelligence\nhave sparked growing interest in automated psychological assessment, yet most\nexisting approaches are constrained by their reliance on static text analysis,\nlimiting their ability to capture deeper and more informative insights that\nemerge through dynamic interaction and iterative questioning. Therefore, in\nthis paper, we propose a multi-agent framework for mental health evaluation\nthat simulates clinical doctor-patient dialogues, with specialized agents\nassigned to questioning, adequacy evaluation, scoring, and updating. We\nintroduce an adaptive questioning mechanism in which an evaluation agent\nassesses the adequacy of user responses to determine the necessity of\ngenerating targeted follow-up queries to address ambiguity and missing\ninformation. Additionally, we employ a tree-structured memory in which the root\nnode encodes the user's basic information, while child nodes (e.g., topic and\nstatement) organize key information according to distinct symptom categories\nand interaction turns. This memory is dynamically updated throughout the\ninteraction to reduce redundant questioning and further enhance the information\nextraction and contextual tracking capabilities. Experimental results on the\nDAIC-WOZ dataset illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which\nachieves better performance than existing approaches."}

However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy,\nimpairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time\napplications. To improve the efficiency, current methods often rely on\nhuman-defined difficulty priors, which do not align with the LLM's self-awared\ndifficulty, leading to inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic\nReasoning-Boundary Self-Awareness Framework (DR. SAF), which enables models to\ndynamically assess and adjust their reasoning depth in response to problem\ncomplexity. DR. SAF integrates three key components: Boundary Self-Awareness\nAlignment, Adaptive Reward Management, and a Boundary Preservation Mechanism.\nThese components allow models to optimize their reasoning processes, balancing\nefficiency and accuracy without compromising performance. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that DR. SAF achieves a 49.27% reduction in total response\ntokens with minimal loss in accuracy. The framework also delivers a 6.59x gain\nin token efficiency and a 5x reduction in training time, making it well-suited\nto resource-limited settings. During extreme training, DR. SAF can even surpass\ntraditional instruction-based models in token efficiency with more than 16%\naccuracy improvement."}

AuriStream learns meaningful phoneme and word representations, and\nstate-of-the-art lexical semantics. AuriStream shows competitive performance on\ndiverse downstream SUPERB speech tasks.

Existing datasets for visual entailment are small and\nsparse compared to datasets for textual entailment. Manually creating datasets\nis labor-intensive. We base our synthetic dataset on the SNLI dataset for\ntextual entailment. We take the premise text from SNLI as input prompts in a\ngenerative image model, Stable Diffusion, creating an image to replace each\ntextual premise. We evaluate our dataset both intrinsically and extrinsically.\nFor extrinsic evaluation, we evaluate the validity of the generated images by\nusing them as training data for a visual entailment classifier based on CLIP\nfeature vectors. We find that synthetic training data only leads to a slight\ndrop in quality on SNLI-VE, with an F-score 0.686 compared to 0.703 when\ntrained on real data. We also compare the quality of our generated training\ndata to original training data on another dataset: SICK-VTE. Again, there is\nonly a slight drop in F-score: from 0.400 to 0.384.
