This paper introduces a novel\napproach to combating misinformation by developing an AI-powered system that\nnot only fact-checks claims made in YouTube videos but also actively engages\nusers in the comment section and challenge misleading narratives. Our system\ncomprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.\n  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search,\nGoogle FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced\nand comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender\nleverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to\ngenerate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive\ndebate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to\niteratively improve its style and refine its output.\n  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established\nbenchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its\npotential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives. Our findings\nhighlight the high accuracy of our fact-checking agent, and confirm the\npotential of AI-driven interventions in combating misinformation and fostering\na more informed online space."}

However, these systems risk reinforcing\nfilter bubbles and political polarization by failing to incorporate diverse\nperspectives. Stance detection -- identifying a text's position on a target --\ncan help mitigate this by enabling viewpoint-aware recommendations and\ndata-driven analyses of media bias. Yet, existing stance detection research\nremains largely limited to short texts and high-resource languages. To address\nthese gaps, we introduce \\textsc{K-News-Stance}, the first Korean dataset for\narticle-level stance detection, comprising 2,000 news articles with\narticle-level and 19,650 segment-level stance annotations across 47 societal\nissues. We also propose \\textsc{JoA-ICL}, a \\textbf{Jo}urnalism-guided\n\\textbf{A}gentic \\textbf{I}n-\\textbf{C}ontext \\textbf{L}earning framework that\nemploys a language model agent to predict the stances of key structural\nsegments (e.g., leads, quotes), which are then aggregated to infer the overall\narticle stance.

To this end, we present DIJA, the first\nsystematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety\nweaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial\ninterleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of\ndLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding.

To support these tasks,\nresearchers have introduced a variety of Process Model Representations (PMRs)\nthat serve as model abstractions or generation targets. However, these PMRs\ndiffer widely in structure, complexity, and usability, and have never been\nsystematically compared. Moreover, recent PMG approaches rely on distinct\nevaluation strategies and generation techniques, making comparison difficult.\nThis paper presents the first empirical study that evaluates multiple PMRs in\nthe context of PMo with LLMs. We introduce the PMo Dataset, a new dataset\ncontaining 55 process descriptions paired with models in nine different PMRs.\nWe evaluate PMRs along two dimensions: suitability for LLM-based PMo and\nperformance on PMG. \\textit{Mermaid} achieves the highest overall score across\nsix PMo criteria, whereas \\textit{BPMN text} delivers the best PMG results in\nterms of process element similarity."}

This paper introduces the Data Contamination Risk\n(DCR) framework, a lightweight, interpretable pipeline designed to detect and\nquantify BDC across four granular levels: semantic, informational, data, and\nlabel. By synthesizing contamination scores via a fuzzy inference system, DCR\nproduces a unified DCR Factor that adjusts raw accuracy to reflect\ncontamination-aware performance. Validated on 9 LLMs (0.5B-72B) across\nsentiment analysis, fake news detection, and arithmetic reasoning tasks, the\nDCR framework reliably diagnoses contamination severity and with accuracy\nadjusted using the DCR Factor to within 4% average error across the three\nbenchmarks compared to the uncontaminated baseline. Emphasizing computational\nefficiency and transparency, DCR provides a practical tool for integrating\ncontamination assessment into routine evaluations, fostering fairer comparisons\nand enhancing the credibility of LLM benchmarking practices."}

Previous work has attempted to\ncompare these architectures, but is forced to make comparisons with models that\nhave different numbers of parameters, training techniques, and datasets. We\nintroduce the SOTA open-data Ettin suite of models: paired encoder-only and\ndecoder-only models ranging from 17 million parameters to 1 billion, trained on\nup to 2 trillion tokens. Using the same recipe for both encoder-only and\ndecoder-only models produces SOTA recipes in both categories for their\nrespective sizes, beating ModernBERT as an encoder and Llama 3.2 and SmolLM2 as\ndecoders. Like previous work, we find that encoder-only models excel at\nclassification and retrieval tasks while decoders excel at generative tasks.\nHowever, we show that adapting a decoder model to encoder tasks (and vice\nversa) through continued training is subpar compared to using only the reverse\nobjective (i.e. a 400M encoder outperforms a 1B decoder on MNLI, and vice versa\nfor generative tasks). We open-source all artifacts of this study including\ntraining data, training order segmented by checkpoint, and 200+ checkpoints to\nallow future work to analyze or extend all aspects of training."}

It is further\nintegrated with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to ensure timely\nand factually grounded information access. The core contribution lies in the\ndesign and implementation of a comprehensive, region-specific AI alignment and\nsafety framework, demonstrated through two key achievements: 1) The successful\ndevelopment of HKGAI-V1 itself - which outper-forms general-purpose models in\nhandling Hong Kong-specific culturally sensitive queries, and embodies a\n\"governance-embedded\" approach to digital sovereignty - empowers Hong Kong to\nexercise control over AI applications in critical sectors including public\nservices, legal systems, and edu-cation. 2) The development of the proprietary\nAdversarial HK Value Benchmark, a rigorous tool for evaluating model alignment\nwith local ethical and legal stand-ards under challenging conditions.
