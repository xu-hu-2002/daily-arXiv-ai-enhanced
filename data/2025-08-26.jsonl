However, manually crafting effective prompts is\nlabor-intensive and demands significant domain expertise, limiting its\nscalability. Existing automatic prompt optimization methods either extensively\nexplore new prompt candidates, incurring high computational costs due to\ninefficient searches within a large solution space, or overly exploit feedback\non existing prompts, risking suboptimal optimization because of the complex\nprompt landscape. To address these challenges, we introduce GreenTEA, an\nagentic LLM workflow for automatic prompt optimization that balances candidate\nexploration and knowledge exploitation. It leverages a collaborative team of\nagents to iteratively refine prompts based on feedback from error samples. An\nanalyzing agent identifies common error patterns resulting from the current\nprompt via topic modeling, and a generation agent revises the prompt to\ndirectly address these key deficiencies. This refinement process is guided by a\ngenetic algorithm framework, which simulates natural selection by evolving\ncandidate prompts through operations such as crossover and mutation to\nprogressively optimize model performance. Extensive numerical experiments\nconducted on public benchmark datasets suggest the superior performance of\nGreenTEA against human-engineered prompts and existing state-of-the-arts for\nautomatic prompt optimization, covering logical and quantitative reasoning,\ncommonsense, and ethical decision-making."}

A common but often implicit\nassumption is that CoT traces should be semantically meaningful and\ninterpretable to the end user. While recent research questions the need for\nsemantic nature of these traces, in this paper, we ask: ``\\textit{Must CoT\nreasoning traces be interpretable to enhance LLM task performance?}\" We\ninvestigate this question in the Open Book Question-Answering domain by\nsupervised fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces:\n(1) DeepSeek R1 traces, (2) LLM-generated summaries of R1 traces, (3)\nLLM-generated post-hoc explanations of R1 traces, and (4) algorithmically\ngenerated verifiably correct traces.

Interestingly, we observe that when processing multiple questions\nin batch mode, RLLMs exhibit more resource-efficient behavior by dynamically\ncompressing reasoning steps for easier problems, due to implicit resource\ncompetition. Inspired by this, we propose Dynamic Reasoning Quota Allocation\n(DRQA), a novel method that transfers the benefits of resource competition from\nbatch processing to single-question inference. Specifically, DRQA leverages\nbatch-generated preference data and reinforcement learning to train the model\nto allocate reasoning resources adaptively. By encouraging the model to\ninternalize a preference for responses that are both accurate and concise, DRQA\nenables it to generate concise answers for simple questions while retaining\nsufficient reasoning depth for more challenging ones. Extensive experiments on\na wide range of mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate\nthat DRQA significantly reduces token usage while maintaining, and in many\ncases improving, answer accuracy.

Recent work suggests that\nLLMs may perform planning - selecting a future target token in advance and\ngenerating intermediate tokens that lead towards it - rather than merely\nimprovising one token at a time. However, existing studies assume fixed\nplanning horizons and often focus on single prompts or narrow domains. To\ndistinguish planning from improvisation across models and tasks, we present\nformal and causally grounded criteria for detecting planning and operationalize\nthem as a semi-automated annotation pipeline. We apply this pipeline to both\nbase and instruction-tuned Gemma-2-2B models on the MBPP code generation\nbenchmark and a poem generation task where Claude 3.5 Haiku was previously\nshown to plan. Our findings show that planning is not universal: unlike Haiku,\nGemma-2-2B solves the same poem generation task through improvisation, and on\nMBPP it switches between planning and improvisation across similar tasks and\neven successive token predictions. We further show that instruction tuning\nrefines existing planning behaviors in the base model rather than creating them\nfrom scratch. Together, these studies provide a reproducible and scalable\nfoundation for mechanistic studies of planning in LLMs."}

However, within Transformer-based encoders,\ndifferent blocks exhibit varying degrees of semantic perception ability. From\nthe perspective of interpretability, the semantic perception potential of\nknowledge neurons is modulated by stimuli, thus rational cross-block\nrepresentation fusion is a direction worth optimizing. To balance the semantic\nredundancy and loss across block fusion, we propose a sentence representation\nselection mechanism S\\textsuperscript{2}Sent, which integrates a parameterized\nnested selector downstream of the Transformer-based encoder.

Despite growing interest in accessibility and inclusivity,\nthe development of robust translation systems remains hindered by the limited\navailability of parallel corpora which align natural language with sign\nlanguage data. Existing methods often struggle to generalize in these\ndata-scarce environments, as the few datasets available are typically\ndomain-specific, lack standardization, or fail to capture the full linguistic\nrichness of sign languages. To address this limitation, we propose Advanced Use\nof LLMs for Sign Language Translation (AulSign), a novel method that leverages\nLarge Language Models via dynamic prompting and in-context learning with sample\nselection and subsequent sign association. Despite their impressive abilities\nin processing text, LLMs lack intrinsic knowledge of sign languages; therefore,\nthey are unable to natively perform this kind of translation. To overcome this\nlimitation, we associate the signs with compact descriptions in natural\nlanguage and instruct the model to use them. We evaluate our method on both\nEnglish and Italian languages using SignBank+, a recognized benchmark in the\nfield, as well as the Italian LaCAM CNR-ISTC dataset.
