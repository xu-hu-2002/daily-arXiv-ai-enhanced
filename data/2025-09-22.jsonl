Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive science\nhave reinvigorated this old question. We argue that language may hold the key\nto the emergence of both more general AI systems and central aspects of human\nintelligence.

One of the\nprimary factors behind the advancement of speech technology is self-supervised\nlearning.

Many existing unlearning methods aim to\nsuppress undesirable outputs through additional training (e.g., gradient\nascent), which reduces the probability of generating such outputs. While such\nsuppression-based approaches can control model outputs, they may not eliminate\nthe underlying knowledge embedded in the model's internal activations; muting a\nresponse is not the same as forgetting it. Moreover, such suppression-based\nmethods often suffer from model collapse. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel unlearning method that directly intervenes in the model's internal\nactivations. In our formulation, forgetting is defined as a state in which the\nactivation of a forgotten target is indistinguishable from that of ``unknown''\nentities. Our method introduces an unlearning objective that modifies the\nactivation of the target entity away from those of known entities and toward\nthose of unknown entities in a sparse autoencoder latent space. By aligning the\ntarget's internal activation with those of unknown entities, we shift the\nmodel's recognition of the target entity from ``known'' to ``unknown'',\nachieving genuine forgetting while avoiding over-suppression and model\ncollapse.

We re-cast task\nadaptation as output-distribution alignment: the objective is to steer the\noutput distribution toward the task distribution directly during decoding\nrather than indirectly through weight updates. Building on this view, we\nintroduce Steering Vector Decoding (SVD), a lightweight, PEFT-compatible, and\ntheoretically grounded method. We start with a short warm-start fine-tune and\nextract a task-aware steering vector from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\ngradient between the output distribution of the warm-started and pre-trained\nmodels. This steering vector is then used to guide the decoding process to\nsteer the model's output distribution towards the task distribution. We\ntheoretically prove that SVD is first-order equivalent to the gradient step of\nfull fine-tuning and derive a globally optimal solution for the strength of the\nsteering vector. Across three tasks and nine benchmarks, SVD paired with four\nstandard PEFT methods improves multiple-choice accuracy by up to 5 points and\nopen-ended truthfulness by 2 points, with similar gains (1-2 points) on\ncommonsense datasets without adding trainable parameters beyond the PEFT\nadapter.
