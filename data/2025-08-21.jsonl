Its\ndifficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image\nsequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance\nbetween these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image\nCaptioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant\nstudies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for\nobtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are\ntransformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our\nmultifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling\nunder a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced\nstories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach\naccelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and\nreproducible by anyone interested. Lastly, we propose a new metric/tool, named\nideality, that can be used to simulate how far some results are from an oracle\nmodel, and we apply it to emulate human-likeness in visual storytelling."}

The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade\nteachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers\nnationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot\nlearning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of\nrandom guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance\nimproves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy\nof their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging\nabilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in\ntheir current training for educationally aligned judgment. Notably, even the\nbest-performing models display systematic directional biases, suggesting\ndifficulties in accurately aligning material difficulty with SCA. Furthermore,\nsignificant variations in model performance across different genres underscore\nthe complexity of task. We envision that ZPD-SCA can provide a foundation for\nevaluating and improving LLMs in cognitively aligned educational applications."}

While large language models (LLMs) have shown great\npromise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation\nclassification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related\nentity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine\nwhether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence\nstructures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such\nhallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the\nintegrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware\nsEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the\nrelation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,\nDEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for\neach pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence\ninto a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise\nwhile preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local\npredictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,\ncorrecting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a\ncausality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling\nspurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning\nwith human feedback.

Not only do\ncurrent approaches to chaining rules suffer in terms of their interpretability,\nthey are also quite constrained in their ability to accommodate extensions to\ntheoretically equivalent reasoning tasks - a model trained to chain rules\ncannot support abduction or identify contradictions. In this work we suggest\naddressing these shortcomings by identifying an intermediate representation\n(which we call the Representation of the Logical Structure (RLS) of the\nargument) that possesses an understanding of the logical structure of a natural\nlanguage argument - the logical atoms in the argument and the rules\nincorporating them.

Therefore, our approach supports all forms of reasoning that\ndepend on the logical structure of the natural language argument, including\narbitrary depths of reasoning, on-the-fly mistake rectification and interactive\ndiscussion with respect to an argument.

Existing approaches suffer from two key\nlimitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and\ndata-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while\nlarge language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural\nlanguage interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical\nreasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose\nTransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal\nmodeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our\napproach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex\ndependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph\nattention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured\nembeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via\nreinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input\ncharacteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework\noperates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations,\ndynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and\nprojecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to\ngenerate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three\ntasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised\nand zero-shot settings. Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers\ncompetitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing\nstrong generalization and cross-task adaptability.

Large language\nmodels (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting and reasoning over this\nunstructured text, but the length of clinical notes often exceeds even\nstate-of-the-art models' extended context windows. Retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) offers an alternative by retrieving task-relevant passages\nfrom across the entire EHR, potentially reducing the amount of required input\ntokens. In this work, we propose three clinical tasks designed to be replicable\nacross health systems with minimal effort: 1) extracting imaging procedures, 2)\ngenerating timelines of antibiotic use, and 3) identifying key diagnoses. Using\nEHRs from actual hospitalized patients, we test three state-of-the-art LLMs\nwith varying amounts of provided context, using either targeted text retrieval\nor the most recent clinical notes. We find that RAG closely matches or exceeds\nthe performance of using recent notes, and approaches the performance of using\nthe models' full context while requiring drastically fewer input tokens. Our\nresults suggest that RAG remains a competitive and efficient approach even as\nnewer models become capable of handling increasingly longer amounts of text."}

We construct\ntranslated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen\n2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT\ngeneration across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments\nreveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot\nlanguage varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves\nperformance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and\nproves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning\nremain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but\ndoes not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune\nusing only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\\% in Swahili. Third,\ndata quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully\ncurated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier\ncorpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results\nclarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated\ndatasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research."}

While general-purpose deep research agents have shown\nimpressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain\nchallenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited\naccuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model\nlacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the\nframework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored\nfor medical contexts.We present a medical deep research agent that addresses\nthese challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data\nsynthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest\nchains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex\nmulti-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private\nmedical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate\nmedical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse\ntrajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool\ninteractions.Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised\nfine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our\nMedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing\nnew state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining\ncompetitive performance on general deep research tasks.

However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains\nchallenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands.\nWhile post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted\ntechnique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely\nunexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing\ndiffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of\nactivation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that\ndominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit\nquantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority\nof values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model\nvariants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width,\nquantization method, task category, and model type. Through this\nmulti-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization\nbehavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide\na foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and\nexperimental setups will be released to support the community."}
