For example, when interacting with a\nchatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM\nto generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its\nintended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on\nhardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to\ndetect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these\nprobabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large\nspace of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and\nevaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by\ndesign. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline\n(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant\nsources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This\nis achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which\ntakes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (\"highlights\") from\nthe retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages\nand summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible\ninstantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of\ncorrectness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an\nLLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better\nthan those of a standard RAG pipeline."}

While many algorithms have been proposed for\nlearning with noisy labels in textual classification problems, the regression\ncounterpart is relatively under-explored.

UPLME includes a\nprobabilistic language model that predicts both empathy score and\nheteroscedastic uncertainty and is trained using Bayesian concepts with\nvariational model ensembling. We further introduce two novel loss components:\none penalises degenerate Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), and another enforces\nthe similarity between the input pairs on which we predict empathy. UPLME\nprovides state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Correlation Coefficient:\n$0.558\\rightarrow0.580$ and $0.629\\rightarrow0.634$) in terms of the\nperformance reported in the literature in two public benchmarks, having label\nnoise.

To address these\nconstraints, we propose EmbedGrad, a novel framework that optimizes text prompt\nembeddings through gradient-based refinement.

This enables fine-grained\ncalibration impossible in text space, such as enhancing the reasoning\ncapability of prompts like please reason step by step. Comprehensive\nevaluations across mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal\njudgment tasks demonstrate EmbedGrad's effectiveness:optimizing this reasoning\nprompt for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B increased accuracy from 14.74\\% to 58.96\\% on\nmathematical problems.

Modeling user\nbehavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has\ngained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual\nmodeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior\nsequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty\nseparators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM\npre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention\nscatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior\nboundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance.\nTo address this, we propose $\\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing\nbehavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios. Inspired\nby attention sink theory, it constructs attention focus sinks and dynamically\nregulates attention aggregation via external information. Specifically, we\ninsert sink tokens between consecutive behaviors, incorporating\nrecommendation-specific signals such as temporal distance to serve as stable\nattention sinks. To enhance generality, we design a two-stage training strategy\nthat explicitly guides LM attention toward sink tokens and a attention sink\nmechanism that amplifies inter-sink dependencies to better capture behavioral\ncorrelations.
