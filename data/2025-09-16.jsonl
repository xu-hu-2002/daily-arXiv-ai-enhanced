Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By\nconcatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train\nthese tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that\nof the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the\nsoft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the\nimportance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining\ndecoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our\nmethod exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction\napproaches.

By performing this reasoning during pre-storage rather than when\ngenerating a response, PREMem creates enriched representations while reducing\ncomputational demands during interactions. Experiments show significant\nperformance improvements across all model sizes, with smaller models achieving\nresults comparable to much larger baselines while maintaining effectiveness\neven with constrained token budgets. Code and dataset are available at\nhttps://github.com/sangyeop-kim/PREMem."}

This is an\nexpensive endeavor and is often infeasible, as model developers tend not to\nrelease their pre-training data. Naive approaches, such as continued\npretraining, suffer from catastrophic forgetting; however, mitigation\nstrategies like experience replay cannot be applied due to the lack of original\npretraining data. In this work, we investigate the problem of continually\nadding new languages to a multilingual model, assuming access to pretraining\ndata in only the target languages. We explore multiple approaches to address\nthis problem and propose Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA), which adds Low-Rank\nAdapters (LoRA) to selected initial and final layers while keeping the rest of\nthe model frozen. LayRA builds on two insights: (1) LoRA reduces forgetting,\nand (2) multilingual models encode inputs in the source language in the initial\nlayers, reason in English in intermediate layers, and translate back to the\nsource language in final layers. We experiment with adding multiple\ncombinations of Galician, Swahili, and Urdu to pretrained language models and\nevaluate each method on diverse multilingual tasks. We find that LayRA provides\nthe overall best tradeoff between preserving models' capabilities in previously\nsupported languages, while being competitive with existing approaches such as\nLoRA in learning new languages. We also demonstrate that using model\narithmetic, the adapted models can be equipped with strong instruction\nfollowing abilities without access to any instruction tuning data in the target\nlanguages."}

AIMS: to build a\ndataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians\npursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate\nand compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the\nfine-tuned LLM.

We selected eight medical LLMs including\nmedgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific\nprompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient\nfine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it\nutilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set).

HARP\nestablishes that the hidden state space of LLMs can be decomposed into a direct\nsum of a semantic subspace and a reasoning subspace, where the former encodes\nlinguistic expression and the latter captures internal reasoning processes.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that the Unembedding layer can disentangle these\nsubspaces, and by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its\nparameters, the basis vectors spanning the semantic and reasoning subspaces are\nobtained.

In this\nwork, we propose AesBiasBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs along two\ncomplementary dimensions: (1) stereotype bias, quantified by measuring\nvariations in aesthetic evaluations across demographic groups; and (2)\nalignment between model outputs and genuine human aesthetic preferences. Our\nbenchmark covers three subtasks (Aesthetic Perception, Assessment, Empathy) and\nintroduces structured metrics (IFD, NRD, AAS) to assess both bias and\nalignment. We evaluate 19 MLLMs, including proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o,\nClaude-3.5-Sonnet) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL-2.5, Qwen2.5-VL).\nResults indicate that smaller models exhibit stronger stereotype biases,\nwhereas larger models align more closely with human preferences.

We report experimental results on multilingual and multimodal\nsemantic tasks, where our SENSE model achieves highly competitive performance.\nFinally, this study offers new insights into how semantics are captured in such\nsemantically aligned speech encoders."}

The results show that LLMs generally outperform\nconventional tools in recognizing context-sensitive entities like person names,\nwith Gemini achieving the highest average F1-score. However, traditional\nsystems like Stanza demonstrate greater consistency in structured tags such as\nLOCATION and DATE. We also observed variability among LLMs, particularly in\nhandling temporal expressions and multi-word organizations. Our findings\nhighlight that while LLMs offer improved contextual understanding, traditional\ntools remain competitive in specific tasks, informing model selection."}

To address efficiency-capability trade-off, we\npropose the Guess-Think-Answer (GTA) framework that combines the efficiency of\nSFT with the capability gains of RL in a unified training paradigm. GTA works\nby having the model first produce a provisional guess (optimized via\ncross-entropy loss), then reflect on this guess before generating the final\nanswer, with RL rewards shaping both the final output and the format of the\nentire GTA structure. This hybrid approach achieves both faster convergence\nthan pure RL and higher performance ceiling than pure SFT. To mitigate gradient\nconflicts between the two training signals, we employ loss masking and gradient\nconstraints. Empirical results on four text classification benchmarks\ndemonstrate that GTA substantially accelerates convergence while outperforming\nboth standalone SFT and RL baselines."}

Consequently, LLMs are\nincreasingly offered as cloud-based services, a paradigm that introduces\ncritical limitations: providers struggle to support personalized customization\nat scale, while users face privacy risks when exposing sensitive data. To\naddress this dual challenge, we propose Customized Black-box Prompt Tuning\n(CBP-Tuning), a novel framework that facilitates efficient local customization\nwhile preserving bidirectional privacy. Specifically, we design a two-stage\nframework: (1) a prompt generator trained on the server-side to capture\ndomain-specific and task-agnostic capabilities, and (2) user-side gradient-free\noptimization that tailors soft prompts for individual tasks. This approach\neliminates the need for users to access model weights or upload private data,\nrequiring only a single customized vector per task while achieving effective\nadaptation. Furthermore, the evaluation of CBP-Tuning in the commonsense\nreasoning, medical and financial domain settings demonstrates superior\nperformance compared to baselines, showcasing its advantages in task-agnostic\nprocessing and privacy preservation."}

A cost effective\nparadigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches\noften cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful\nways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a\ntext retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called\nRAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition\nLLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting\nand introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output\n(IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References\n(IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation\ntasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy\nincorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens\nfrom the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing\ninteractions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and\nremain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL)\nmethods.
