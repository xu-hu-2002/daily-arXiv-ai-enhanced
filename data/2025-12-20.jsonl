We present TabReX, a reference-less, property-driven framework for evaluating tabular generation via graph-based reasoning. TabReX converts both source text and generated tables into canonical knowledge graphs, aligns them through an LLM-guided matching process, and computes interpretable, rubric-aware scores that quantify structural and factual fidelity. The resulting metric provides controllable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, yielding human-aligned judgments and cell-level error traces. To systematically asses metric robustness, we introduce TabReX-Bench, a large-scale benchmark spanning six domains and twelve planner-driven perturbation types across three difficulty tiers. Empirical results show that TabReX achieves the highest correlation with expert rankings, remains stable under harder perturbations, and enables fine-grained model-vs-prompt analysis establishing a new paradigm for trustworthy, explainable evaluation of structured generation systems."}

Yet, computational models of reader response are limited, preventing nuanced analyses. To address this gap, we introduce SocialStoryFrames, a formalism for distilling plausible inferences about reader response, such as perceived author intent, explanatory and predictive reasoning, affective responses, and value judgments, using conversational context and a taxonomy grounded in narrative theory, linguistic pragmatics, and psychology. We develop two models, SSF-Generator and SSF-Classifier, validated through human surveys (N=382 participants) and expert annotations, respectively. We conduct pilot analyses to showcase the utility of the formalism for studying storytelling at scale. Specifically, applying our models to SSF-Corpus, a curated dataset of 6,140 social media stories from diverse contexts, we characterize the frequency and interdependence of storytelling intents, and we compare and contrast narrative practices (and their diversity) across communities. By linking fine-grained, context-sensitive modeling with a generic taxonomy of reader responses, SocialStoryFrames enable new research into storytelling in online communities."}

The volume of personal information has historically been restricted and thus little exploration has gone into understanding what kind of information is most informative for predicting annotator labels. In this work, we categorize self-disclosure sentences and use them to build annotator models for predicting judgments of social norms. We perform several ablations and analyses to examine the impact of the type of information on our ability to predict annotation patterns. We find that demographics are more impactful than attitudes, relationships, and experiences. Generally, theory-based approaches worked better than automatic clusters.

However, existing benchmarks for LLM-as-a-Judge are mainly relying on human-annotated ground truth, which introduces human bias that undermines the assessment of reliability and imposes scalability constraints. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sage, a novel evaluation suite that assesses the quality of LLM judges without necessitating any human annotation. Inspired by axioms of rational choice theory, Sage introduces two new lenses for measuring LLM-as-a-Judge: local self-consistency (pair-wise preference stability) and global logical consistency (transitivity across a full set of preferences). We curate a dataset of 650 questions by combining structured benchmark problems with real-world user queries. Our experiments demonstrate both the stability of our metrics and their high correlation with supervised benchmarks like LLMBar and RewardBench2, confirming Sage's reliability as an evaluation suite for the robustness and accuracy of LLM-as-a-Judge. Based on Sage, we reveal that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant reliability problems when acting as judges in both scoring and pairwise settings; even the top-performing models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5, fail to maintain consistent preferences in nearly a quarter of difficult cases. We attribute this to a new phenomenon called situational preference, which explains why explicit rubrics or criteria can help the model judge consistently across answer pairs. Our further analysis shows that finetuned LLM-as-a-Judge is a feasible method to boost performance, and the panel-based judge as well as deep reasoning can enhance the judging consistency. We also find substantial inconsistency in human judgments, which indicates that human annotation may not be a reliable gold standard."}

However, existing methods often generate text that mimics the linguistic style of radiologists but fails to guarantee clinical correctness, because they are trained on token-level objectives which focus on word-choice and sentence structure rather than actual medical accuracy. We propose a semantic-driven reinforcement learning (SRL) method for medical report generation, adopted on a large vision-language model (LVLM). SRL adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage clinical-correctness-guided learning beyond imitation of language style. Specifically, we optimise a report-level reward: a margin-based cosine similarity (MCCS) computed between key radiological findings extracted from generated and reference reports, thereby directly aligning clinical-label agreement and improving semantic correctness. A lightweight reasoning format constraint further guides the model to generate structured \"thinking report\" outputs. We evaluate Medical Report Generation with Sematic-driven Reinforment Learning (MRG-R1), on two datasets: IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR using clinical efficacy (CE) metrics. MRG-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with CE-F1 51.88 on IU X-Ray and 40.39 on MIMIC-CXR. We found that the label-semantic reinforcement is better than conventional token-level supervision. These results indicate that optimizing a clinically grounded, report-level reward rather than token overlap,meaningfully improves clinical correctness. This work is a prior to explore semantic-reinforcement in supervising medical correctness in medical Large vision-language model(Med-LVLM) training."}

This approach enables the model to handle noisy, heterogeneous text while reliably extracting 15 key fields, including location, event characteristics, and impact assessment, from a high-quality, manually annotated dataset of 4,933 instances derived from 27,822 police briefing posts on Chinese Weibo (2019-2020).

Our model is fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa) on the MIMIC III dataset and is paired with the fact-checking module, which uses numerical tests for correctness and logical checks at a granular level through discrete logic in natural language processing (NLP) to validate facts against electronic health records (EHRs).

Developing efficient strategies for updating model knowledge without the expense and disruption of full retraining remains a critical challenge. Current model editing techniques frequently struggle to generalize corrections beyond narrow domains, leading to unintended consequences and limiting their practical impact. Here, we introduce a novel framework for editing LLMs, grounded in information bottleneck theory. This approach precisely compresses and isolates the essential information required for generalizable knowledge correction while minimizing disruption to unrelated model behaviors. Building upon this foundation, we present the Information Bottleneck Knowledge Editor (IBKE), which leverages compact latent representations to guide gradient-based updates, enabling robust and broadly applicable model editing. We validate IBKE's effectiveness across multiple LLM architectures and standard benchmark tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy and improved generality and specificity of edits. These findings establish a theoretically principled and practical paradigm for open-domain knowledge editing, advancing the utility and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world applications."}

LoPA concurrently explores distinct candidate TFOs via parallel branches, and selects the one with the highest potential for future parallelism based on branch confidence.

Notably, LoPA increases the TPF of D2F-Dream to 10.1 on the GSM8K while maintaining performance superior to the Dream baseline.

Sigma-MoE-Tiny is pre-trained on a diverse and high-quality corpus, followed by post-training to further unlock its capabilities. The entire training process remains remarkably stable, with no occurrence of irrecoverable loss spikes. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that, despite activating only 0.5B parameters, Sigma-MoE-Tiny achieves top-tier performance among counterparts of comparable or significantly larger scale.

We release our models and code to establish a simple, validated baseline for the community."}

While existing NL-to-TL translation frameworks have demonstrated encouraging initial results, these systems either explicitly assume access to accurate atom grounding or suffer from low grounded translation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework for Grounding Natural Language Into System Signatures for Temporal Logic translation called GinSign. The framework introduces a grounding model that learns the abstract task of mapping NL spans onto a given system signature: given a lifted NL specification and a system signature $\\mathcal{S}$, the classifier must assign each lifted atomic proposition to an element of the set of signature-defined atoms $\\mathcal{P}$. We decompose the grounding task hierarchically -- first predicting predicate labels, then selecting the appropriately typed constant arguments. Decomposing this task from a free-form generation problem into a structured classification problem permits the use of smaller masked language models and eliminates the reliance on expensive LLMs. Experiments across multiple domains show that frameworks which omit grounding tend to produce syntactically correct lifted LTL that is semantically nonequivalent to grounded target expressions, whereas our framework supports downstream model checking and achieves grounded logical-equivalence scores of $95.5\\%$, a $1.4\\times$ improvement over SOTA."}

A Conflict-Aware Trust-Score (CATS) pipeline is introduced which evaluates groundedness, factual correctness, refusal accuracy, and conflict-behavior alignment using an LLM-as-a-Judge. Our 539-query reasoning dataset and evaluation pipeline establish a foundation for conflict-aware, interpretable RAG systems.

We study this trade-off in glycobiology, a visually dense domain. We built a benchmark of 120 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from 25 papers, stratified by retrieval difficulty (easy text, medium figures/tables, hard cross-evidence). We implemented four augmentations-None, Text RAG, Multi-modal conversion, and late-interaction visual retrieval (ColPali)-using Docling parsing and Qdrant indexing. We evaluated mid-size open-source and frontier proprietary models (e.g., Gemma-3-27B-IT, GPT-4o family). Additional testing used the GPT-5 family and multiple visual retrievers (ColPali/ColQwen/ColFlor). Accuracy with Agresti-Coull 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was computed over 5 runs per configuration. With Gemma-3-27B-IT, Text and Multi-modal augmentation outperformed OCR-free retrieval (0.722-0.740 vs. 0.510 average accuracy). With GPT-4o, Multi-modal achieved 0.808, with Text 0.782 and ColPali 0.745 close behind; within-model differences were small. In follow-on experiments with the GPT-5 family, the best results with ColPali and ColFlor improved by ~2% to 0.828 in both cases. In general, across the GPT-5 family, ColPali, ColQwen, and ColFlor were statistically indistinguishable. GPT-5-nano trailed larger GPT-5 variants by roughly 8-10%. Pipeline choice is capacity-dependent: converting visuals to text lowers the reader burden and is more reliable for mid-size models, whereas OCR-free visual retrieval becomes competitive under frontier models. Among retrievers, ColFlor offers parity with heavier options at a smaller footprint, making it an efficient default when strong generators are available."}

State-of-the-art approaches decompose the task into a lifting of atomic propositions (APs) phase and a translation phase. However, existing methods struggle with accurate lifting, the existence of co-references, and learning from limited data. In this paper, we propose a framework for NL to TL translation called Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT). The framework is based on the observation that previous work solves both the lifting and translation steps by letting a language model iteratively predict tokens from its full vocabulary. In contrast, GraFT reduces the complexity of both tasks by restricting the set of valid output tokens from the full vocabulary to only a handful in each step. The solution space reduction is obtained by exploiting the unique properties of each problem. We also provide a theoretical justification for why the solution space reduction leads to more efficient learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of GraFT using the CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art translation approaches, it can be observed that GraFT the end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain translation accuracy by 14.06% on average."}

Characterizing How Meaningful Information is Distributed Across Multiple Channels", "comment": null, "summary": "Prosody -- the melody of speech -- conveys critical information often not captured by the words or text of a message. In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic approach to quantify how much information is expressed by prosody alone and not by text, and crucially, what that information is about. Our approach applies large speech and language models to estimate the mutual information between a particular dimension of an utterance's meaning (e.g., its emotion) and any of its communication channels (e.g., audio or text). We then use this approach to quantify how much information is conveyed by audio and text about sarcasm, emotion, and questionhood, using speech from television and podcasts. We find that for sarcasm and emotion the audio channel -- and by implication the prosodic channel -- transmits over an order of magnitude more information about these features than the text channel alone, at least when long-term context beyond the current sentence is unavailable. For questionhood, prosody provides comparatively less additional information. We conclude by outlining a program applying our approach to more dimensions of meaning, communication channels, and languages."}

While existing caching mechanisms,such as token-level key-value caches, offer speedups in autore-gressive decoding, they are limited in scope and applicability. In this paper, we present LLMCache, a novel layer-wise caching framework that accelerates transformer inference by reusing intermediate activations based on semantic similarity of input sequences. Unlike prior work, LLMCache is model-agnostic,operates across both encoder and decoder architectures, and supports caching at arbitrary transformer layers. We introduce a lightweight fingerprinting mechanism for matching seman-tically similar inputs and propose adaptive eviction strategies to manage cache staleness. Experiments on BERT and GPT-2 across SQuAD, WikiText-103, and OpenBookQA show up to 3.1 X speedup in inference time with <0.5% accuracy degradation. Our results highlight LLMCache as a practical and general-purpose solution for optimizing transformer inference in real-world applications"}

Code and artifacts will be uploaded to https://github.com/hank0316/AdaSearch", "summary": "Equipping large language models (LLMs) with search engines via reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for building search agents. However, overreliance on search introduces unnecessary cost and risks exposure to noisy or malicious content, while relying solely on parametric knowledge risks hallucination. The central challenge is to develop agents that adaptively balance parametric knowledge with external search, invoking search only when necessary. Prior work mitigates search overuse by shaping rewards around the number of tool calls. However, these penalties require substantial reward engineering, provide ambiguous credit assignment, and can be exploited by agents that superficially reduce calls. Moreover, evaluating performance solely through call counts conflates necessary and unnecessary search, obscuring the measurement of true adaptive behavior. To address these limitations, we first quantify the self-knowledge awareness of existing search agents via an F1-based decision metric, revealing that methods such as Search-R1 often overlook readily available parametric knowledge. Motivated by these findings, we propose AdaSearch, a simple two-stage, outcome-driven RL framework that disentangles problem solving from the decision of whether to invoke search, and makes this decision process explicit and interpretable. This transparency is crucial for high-stakes domains such as finance and medical question answering, yet is largely neglected by prior approaches. Experiments across multiple model families and sizes demonstrate that AdaSearch substantially improves knowledge-boundary awareness, reduces unnecessary search calls, preserves strong task performance, and offers more transparent, interpretable decision behaviors."}

MMRB2 spans four tasks: text-to-image, image editing, interleaved generation, and multimodal reasoning (\"thinking-with-images\"), providing 1,000 expert-annotated preference pairs per task from 23 models and agents across 21 source tasks. MMRB2 is designed with: (1) practical but challenging prompts; (2) responses from state-of-the-art models and agents; and (3) preference pairs with strong human-expert consensus, curated via an ensemble filtering strategy. Using MMRB2, we study existing judges for each subtask, including multimodal LLM-as-a-judge and models trained with human preferences. The latest Gemini 3 Pro attains 75-80% accuracy. GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro reach 66-75% accuracy, compared to >90% for humans, yet surpass the widely used GPT-4o (59%). The best performing open-source model Qwen3-VL-32B achieves similar accuracies as Gemini 2.5 Flash (64%).

While prior work has found that transformers develop geometric embeddings that mirror algebraic structure, those previous findings emerge from settings where arithmetic-valued tokens have fixed meanings. We devise a new task in which the assignment of symbols to specific algebraic group elements varies from one sequence to another. Despite this challenging setup, transformers achieve near-perfect accuracy on the task and even generalize to unseen algebraic groups. We develop targeted data distributions to create causal tests of a set of hypothesized mechanisms, and we isolate three mechanisms models consistently learn: commutative copying where a dedicated head copies answers, identity element recognition that distinguishes identity-containing facts, and closure-based cancellation that tracks group membership to constrain valid answers. Complementary to the geometric representations found in fixed-symbol settings, our findings show that models develop symbolic reasoning mechanisms when trained to reason in-context with variables whose meanings are not fixed."}

Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility of intervening directly on such circuits to make precise, task-targeted updates. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method called Constructive Circuit Amplification which identifies pivotal tokens from model reasoning traces as well as model components responsible for the desired task, and updates only those components. Applied to mathematical reasoning, it improves accuracy by up to +11.4% across multiple models while modifying as little as 1.59% of model components, with minimal impact on other abilities as measured by MMLU, TriviaQA, and TruthfulQA. These results demonstrate that targeted capabilities can be reliably enhanced by selectively updating a sparse set of model components."}
