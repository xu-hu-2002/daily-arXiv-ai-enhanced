In many real world scenarios, text may contain more than one language,\nparticularly in multilingual communities. Bilingual Language Identification\n(BLID) is the task of identifying and distinguishing between two languages in a\ngiven text. This paper presents BLID for languages spoken in the southern part\nof Ethiopia, namely Wolaita and Gofa. The presence of words similarities and\ndifferences between the two languages makes the language identification task\nchallenging. To overcome this challenge, we employed various experiments on\nvarious approaches. Then, the combination of the BERT based pretrained language\nmodel and LSTM approach performed better, with an F1 score of 0.72 on the test\nset.

Current safety measures struggle to\npreserve the general capabilities of the LLM while resisting a determined\nadversary with full access to the model's weights and architecture, who can use\nfull-parameter fine-tuning to erase existing safeguards. To address this, we\nintroduce AntiDote, a bi-level optimization procedure for training LLMs to be\nresistant to such tampering. AntiDote involves an auxiliary adversary\nhypernetwork that learns to generate malicious Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nweights conditioned on the defender model's internal activations. The defender\nLLM is then trained with an objective to nullify the effect of these\nadversarial weight additions, forcing it to maintain its safety alignment. We\nvalidate this approach against a diverse suite of 52 red-teaming attacks,\nincluding jailbreak prompting, latent space manipulation, and direct\nweight-space attacks. AntiDote is upto 27.4\\% more robust against adversarial\nattacks compared to both tamper-resistance and unlearning baselines.

While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\narchitectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing,\nlimiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular\nalignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE)\nwithin the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained\nexperts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated,\ntask-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified,\nalignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard\nalignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and\nTruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines,\nachieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score,\nand 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and\ninference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation\nstudies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model\nevaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones."}

To bridge this gap,\nexisting research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a\nreference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then\nused for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that\nthere are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy\nmultilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not\nall English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low\nquality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods\nusually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference\npairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data\nselection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for\nimproving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes\ntwo parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual\nconsistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental\nresults on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and\nsuperiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of\nconstructing high-quality preference data."}

Such variation can introduce systematic\nbiases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type\nI, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.\n  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks\nfrom 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.\nAnalyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure\nhow plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find\nincorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three\nhypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small\nlanguage models.
