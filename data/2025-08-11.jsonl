Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a\ncurriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these\ncurated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a\nplug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes\nacross diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as\ndecreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a\nrange of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in\ndistilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up\nto 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a\nplug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying\nKD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are\npivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a\nprincipled framework to achieve both. This work advances the understanding of\ndata-centric factors in KD and offers practical insights for enhancing the\ncapability and efficiency of compressed LLMs."}

Using attention\nweight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social\nattribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is\nformed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the\nStereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including\ngender, profession, religion, and race.

A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which\nprunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.\nHowever, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,\napplying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and\nstatistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal\ntrade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful\nones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \\textbf{TADrop}\n(\\textbf{T}ensor-wise \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{Drop}), an adaptive\nsparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global\nratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based\non its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with\ndenser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,\nmore critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we\nvalidate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging\nmethods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and\nmultimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and\nsignificantly boosts their performance.

However, its non-isolated execution context introduces\ncritical security and privacy risks. In particular, adversarially crafted\ncontent can induce tool poisoning or indirect prompt injection, leading to\nconversation hijacking, misinformation propagation, or data exfiltration.\nExisting defenses, such as rule-based filters or LLM-driven detection, remain\ninadequate due to their reliance on static signatures, computational\ninefficiency, and inability to quantify conversational hijacking. To address\nthese limitations, we propose SecMCP, a secure framework that detects and\nquantifies conversation drift, deviations in latent space trajectories induced\nby adversarial external knowledge. By modeling LLM activation vectors within a\nlatent polytope space, SecMCP identifies anomalous shifts in conversational\ndynamics, enabling proactive detection of hijacking, misleading, and data\nexfiltration. We evaluate SecMCP on three state-of-the-art LLMs (Llama3,\nVicuna, Mistral) across benchmark datasets (MS MARCO, HotpotQA, FinQA),\ndemonstrating robust detection with AUROC scores exceeding 0.915 while\nmaintaining system usability. Our contributions include a systematic\ncategorization of MCP security threats, a novel latent polytope-based\nmethodology for quantifying conversation drift, and empirical validation of\nSecMCP's efficacy."}

Their adaptability raises the question of\nwhether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer\nto unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we\nfine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or\nmultilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter\nacross 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific\ndiscourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables\ncross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects\npre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages\ncan reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However,\nidentifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance\nbenefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant\nlanguages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during\nfine-tuning (as little as $9.62\\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training\ntoken volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption\nthat cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited\nlanguage coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural\nbiases can be corrected with lightweight interventions. By releasing\n4-bit-quantised, LoRA fine-tuned models, we provide an open-source,\nreproducible alternative to proprietary LLMs that delivers 35 times faster\ninference at just 0.00000989% of the dollar cost of the OpenAI GPT-4o model,\nenabling scalable, inclusive research."}

Using three advanced AI-text detectors (e.g.,\nBinoculars, Fast-Detect GPT, and GPTZero), we find substantial increase of\nGenAI use in recent years, especially in local and college news.

While several existing methods optimize attention\ncomputation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer,\nlimiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative\nframework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical\nprompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information\ndiffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through\nlayers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion\nprocess suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive\ntokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states.\nMotivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning\nmechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at\nintermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous\nKV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex\npredictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments\nshow that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\\mathbf{2.53\\times}$ time-to-first-token\n(TTFT) speedup and $\\mathbf{1.88\\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for\nLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on\nLongBench.

While previous multimodal\nresearch has focused primarily on vision and audio, haptic signals for the\nsense of touch remain underexplored. To address this gap, we formalize the\nhaptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language\nmodel that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory,\nemotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic\ntokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that\nconvert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their\nintegration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)\nsupervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,\nand (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We\nassess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics\nand human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in\ninterpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a\nBLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated\ncaptions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF\nyielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating\nstronger alignment with human haptic perception.
