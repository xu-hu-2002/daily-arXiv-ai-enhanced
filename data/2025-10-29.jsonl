While research has\nfocused on the development of complex memory systems, it remains unclear which\ntypes of memory are most effective for long-context conversational tasks. We\npresent a systematic evaluation of memory-augmented methods using LoCoMo, a\nbenchmark of synthetic long-context dialogues annotated for question-answering\ntasks that require diverse reasoning strategies. We analyse full-context\nprompting, semantic memory through retrieval-augmented generation and agentic\nmemory, episodic memory through in-context learning, and procedural memory\nthrough prompt optimization. Our findings show that memory-augmented approaches\nreduce token usage by over 90% while maintaining competitive accuracy. Memory\narchitecture complexity should scale with model capability, with small\nfoundation models benefitting most from RAG, and strong instruction-tuned\nreasoning model gaining from episodic learning through reflections and more\ncomplex agentic semantic memory. In particular, episodic memory can help LLMs\nrecognise the limits of their own knowledge."}

However, a key limitation is their temporal blindness: they, by\ndefault, operate with a stationary context, failing to account for the\nreal-world time elapsed between messages. This becomes a critical liability\nwhen an agent must decide whether to invoke a tool based on how much time has\npassed since the last observation. Without temporal awareness, agents often\neither over-rely on previous context (skipping necessary tool calls), or\nunder-rely on it (unnecessarily repeating tool calls). To study this challenge,\nwe introduce TicToc-v1, a test set of multi-turn user-agent trajectories across\n34 scenarios with varying time sensitivity. Each trajectory ends with a user\nquestion, where the need for a tool call depends on the amount of time elapsed\nsince the last message. To give LLMs temporal context, we augment dialogue\nmessages with explicit timestamps, bridging the gap between static dialogue and\nevolving environments. We then collected human preferences for these samples,\ncreating two subsets: one where humans preferred relying on the previous\nobservation (prefer-noTool), and another where they preferred a new tool call\n(prefer-Tool). We evaluated how well LLM tool-calling decisions align with\nhuman preferences under varying time intervals on TicToc-v1.

This\nindiscriminate mimicry can introduce noise, as the student is forced to learn\nfrom the teacher's uncertain or high-entropy predictions, which may ultimately\nharm student performance-especially when the teacher is much larger and more\npowerful. To address this, we propose Speculative Knowledge Distillation\n(SpecKD), a novel, plug-and-play framework that introduces a dynamic,\ntoken-level gating mechanism inspired by the \"propose-and-verify\" paradigm of\nspeculative decoding. At each step, the student's token proposal is verified\nagainst the teacher's distribution; the distillation loss is selectively\napplied only to \"accepted\" tokens, while \"rejected\" tokens are masked out.\nExtensive experiments on diverse text generation tasks show that SpecKD\nconsistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines, leading to more\nstable training and more capable student models, and achieving state-of-the-art\nresults."}

Our approach uses simulated\nreference games between models, and requires no additional human-produced data.\nIn repeated reference games involving photographs and tangram images, our\nmethod enables models to communicate efficiently with people: reducing the\nmessage length by up to 41% while increasing success by 15% over the course of\nthe interaction.

This\nexternal focus overlooks that hallucinations may require tailored mitigation\nstrategies based on their underlying mechanism. We propose a framework for\ncategorizing hallucinations along two axes: knowledge and certainty. Since\nparametric knowledge and certainty may vary across models, our categorization\nmethod involves a model-specific dataset construction process that\ndifferentiates between those types of hallucinations. Along the knowledge axis,\nwe distinguish between hallucinations caused by a lack of knowledge and those\noccurring despite the model having the knowledge of the correct response. To\nvalidate our framework along the knowledge axis, we apply steering mitigation,\nwhich relies on the existence of parametric knowledge to manipulate model\nactivations. This addresses the lack of existing methods to validate knowledge\ncategorization by showing a significant difference between the two\nhallucination types. We further analyze the distinct knowledge and\nhallucination patterns between models, showing that different hallucinations do\noccur despite shared parametric knowledge. Turning to the certainty axis, we\nidentify a particularly concerning subset of hallucinations where models\nhallucinate with certainty despite having the correct knowledge internally. We\nintroduce a new evaluation metric to measure the effectiveness of mitigation\nmethods on this subset, revealing that while some methods perform well on\naverage, they fail disproportionately on these critical cases.

We evaluate three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA\n8B) on two datasets-BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing questions),\nand manipulate the number and type of few-shot examples, prompting strategies,\nand training procedure.

We propose a model that represents the text modality using\nan encoder extracted from our own pre-trained model named CATT. The speech\ncomponent is handled by the encoder module of the OpenAI Whisper base model.\nOur solution is designed following two integration strategies. The former\nconsists of fusing the speech tokens with the input at an early stage, where\nthe 1500 frames of the audio segment are averaged over 10 consecutive frames,\nresulting in 150 speech tokens. To ensure embedding compatibility, these\naveraged tokens are processed through a linear projection layer prior to\nmerging them with the text tokens. Contextual encoding is guaranteed by the\nCATT encoder module. The latter strategy relies on cross-attention, where text\nand speech embeddings are fused. The cross-attention output is then fed to the\nCATT classification head for token-level diacritic prediction. To further\nimprove model robustness, we randomly deactivate the speech input during\ntraining, allowing the model to perform well with or without speech.

Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor\ngenerates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the\nresponse accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward\nsignals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to\nunsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive\nfeedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response\nis high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains.\nTo overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In\nstage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct\nrule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on\nactor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its\ndiscriminability via appropriate regularization.

Detecting and\nevaluating these biases can be challenging because they are often implicit\nrather than explicit in nature, so developing evaluation methods that assess\nthe implicit knowledge representations of LLMs is essential. We present a novel\nword association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs\nbased on simulating semantic priming within LLM-generated word association\nnetworks. Our prompt-based approach taps into the implicit relational\nstructures encoded in LLMs, providing both quantitative and qualitative\nassessments of bias.

To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we\napply it to both humans and several widely used LLMs to investigate social\nbiases related to gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and\npolitical party.

However,\nwhen a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced.\nDisambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS\nassociated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging.\nThe problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language\nprocessing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking,\nexpression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc.\nLexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural\nlanguage processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce\nmultiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct\nsolution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence\nrate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is\nunrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a\nlexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate\nand implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993). We present here a formal\ndescription of this method. We show that to verify a local disambiguation\ngrammar in this framework, it is not sufficient to consider the transducer\npaths separately: one needs to verify their interactions. Similarly, if a\ncombination of multiple transducers is used, the result cannot be predicted by\nconsidering them in isolation. Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling\nof a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come\nspontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often\ndue to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity. If a zero silence rate is\ntargeted, local grammars must be carefully tested. This is where a detailed\nspecification of what a grammar will do once applied to texts would be\nnecessary."}

Yet\nmost agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process, and existing\nbenchmarks cannot assess this capability. To address this gap, we introduce\nInteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can\nrecognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search.\nFollowing the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we\nconstruct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a\ntarget-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only\nthrough interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best\nmodel achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context,\nexposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced\ninteraction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current\nstrategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities\nstagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold,\nrevealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate\nfeedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for\nboth evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents.

We\naddress this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our\nempirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of\nground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final\nanswer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a\ndense entity-aware reward function.
