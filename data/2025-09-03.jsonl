Recent progress in\nAutomated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped\nthis challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously\nresulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information\nsuch as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a\nmodular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs\nseparate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and\nlipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a\nsequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight\ntransformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined\nrepresentation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation.\nOur method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a\nBLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging\nChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset.

Our investigation\nreveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length\nCollapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF\ntraining, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score\ndrops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally\ncompromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities.

Moreover, semantic speech\nrepresentations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information,\nwhile semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level\nresolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic\naggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations.\nA speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on\nlarge-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns.

We investigate\nthis diachronic shift through historical text analysis, a large-scale corpus\nstudy which confirms the stark absence of perfective forms and subjective\nevaluation tasks with native speakers, who judge perfective examples as highly\nunnatural.

Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding\ndocuments as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content.\nHowever, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and\nfine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA,\nleading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies\nsolely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG,\nresulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore,\nachieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level\nperformance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In\nthis paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled\nparametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and\nparameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and\nmulti-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the\nplaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a\nparameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally,\nguided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard\nRAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without\noriginal documents.

However,\nprocessing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and\ndemands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced\nthroughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system\nefficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary\nobjective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In\nRAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,\nwith only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often\nexhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during\nre-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those\nin standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most\ncomputations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be\neliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,\nan efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve\nlatency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we\ndemonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to\nprevious work) without loss in perplexity.

Based on the urgency of identifying\nAI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel\nbenchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first\nconstruct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six\nprofessional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.\nSubsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on\nthis dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be\nused as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The\nmost difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially\nstyle.

Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract\nnews semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,\nstylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues\ncan easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in\ndynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news\nlandscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective\nby incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and\nsemantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one\ncan deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than\nthe surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose\nGraph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,\nwhich models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via\ngraph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and\nintent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context\ninteraction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and\nimplementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve\nbetter alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic\npathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and\naggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive\nexperiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

To answer this\nquestion, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)\nacross 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12\ndiverse prompt templates.

However, existing methods have limitations when\ndealing with multimodal documents: one category of methods relies on layout\nanalysis and text extraction, which can only utilize explicit text information\nand struggle to capture images or unstructured content; the other category\ntreats document segmentation as visual input and directly passes it to visual\nlanguage models (VLMs) for processing, yet it ignores the semantic advantages\nof text, leading to suboptimal generation results. This paper proposes\nco-modality-based RAG (CMRAG), which can simultaneously leverage text and\nimages for efficient retrieval and generation. Specifically, we first perform\nstructured parsing on documents to obtain co-modality representations of text\nsegments and image regions. Subsequently, in response to user queries, we\nretrieve candidate evidence from text and image channels, respectively, and\naggregate the results at the cross-modal retrieval level.

Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci's historical\nstatus but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to\nmachine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as\nTroyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history\nof the field is understood."}

Existing truncated sampling techniques, including\ntemperature scaling, top-\\$p\\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\\$p\\$ sampling, aim\nto manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in\nthe effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the\ncorresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\\$p\\$ sampling relies on a\nsingle top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the\ninformation of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of\nthe confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We\nfirst establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity\nand coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained\nminimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be\nequivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem,\nwhich is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally\nefficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical\nevaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA)\nalternative of min-\\$p\\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing\nbenchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as\nGPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms\nthat top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where\ncreativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in\nopen-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing\napplications.

RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards\nto guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output\nquality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR\nparadigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from\nsparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in\nRL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\\textbf{PACS}$, a\nnovel RLVR framework that achieves im$\\textbf{P}$licit $\\textbf{A}$ctor\n$\\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By\ntreating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR\nproblem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by\nthe policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient\nanalysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the\nclassical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic\nroles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging\nmathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as\nPPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS\nachieves 59.78\\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32\nand 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a\npromising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and\ndata are available as open source at https://github.com/ritzz-ai/PACS."}

This creates a tension: while\npost-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions\nand reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and\nexploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We\naddress this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a\nframework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity.\nAt its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure\ndiversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is\nthen combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning,\nencouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct.\nExperiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING\ngeneralizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and\ncreative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks\nin the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL\nbaselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and\nnovelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution\nquality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing\nfor diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as\nhigher-quality responses."}

As this data is predominantly\nsourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards\nhigh-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently,\nLLMs often exhibit a diminished understanding of certain communities, a gap\nthat is particularly evident in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures.\nThis issue becomes even more pronounced with increasingly under-represented\ntopics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first\nshared task designed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these\nspecific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring\nmultiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General\nArabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range\nof topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and\nlanguage expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew\nconsiderable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for\nSubtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our\nfindings reveal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance\nover baseline models.
