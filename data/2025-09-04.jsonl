Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA)\nmechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of\ninput lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while\nmaintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance\noptimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion\nsteps, significantly improving generation speed.

To address this, we introduce\nSinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed\nspecifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over\n7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with\nthe Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects,\nencompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We\nevaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and\nGPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively,\noverall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in\nculturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for\nimprovement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts."}

However, the internal processes through which models turn data\ninto representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly\nunderstood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs\nwith knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete.\nTo facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing\nknowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a\nknowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based\non Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that\noutperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained\nmodels with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with\ncomparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks.\nTogether, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing\nconnections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance,\nand the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the\nutility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding\nthat fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We\nrelease LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge\nrepresentations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics."}

Twofold goals are examined; to understand the\nmechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay\nbetween the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks.\nThe following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT)\nincreased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over\nall tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which\nincreased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among\ntokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as\ninferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened\nalong the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance\nconsiderably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently,\nhigher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though\nthe learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token.\nThese pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy\nalong the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction\nconfidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input\nmeaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match\ntokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image\nclassification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in\nfine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results\nwere based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and\nfine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks."}

Despite its\nsignificance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access\nto educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social\nexclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend\non Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although\ncertain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for\nindividuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent\nrequirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially\nfor Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions\nhave primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a\nconsiderable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language,\nspecifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of\nisolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of\ncontinuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research\nrepresents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we\nintroduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL,\nfocusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable\nsophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation.\nAdditionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained\nResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with\nBidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\\% accuracy at\nsigner dependent mode and 77.71\\% accuracy at signer independent mode.
