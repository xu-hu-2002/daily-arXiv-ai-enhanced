A central\nquestion is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized\nfunctions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's\ncore cognitive abilities. We introduce \"cyclic ablation,\" an iterative method\nto test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and\nadversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of\ndeception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception\nwas highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior\nafter each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term\nfunctional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this \"neurosurgery\" caused\na gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by\na consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view\nthat complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the\nlimitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability."}

Specifically, these\nminimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from\nan official online resource maintained by a Qu\\'ebec government institution.\nEach pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the\nsentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used\nto compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different\nLLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher\nprobabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category.\nWe find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear\nhierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on\nphenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical\nlimitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these\nspecific tasks."}

In this work, we study benchmark\nreliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,\nwhich measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the\nsubdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark\nproperty, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence\nacross subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model\nfamilies, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed\nacross models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable\nevaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give\nmisleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced\nby specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on\nBiological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,\nPhysics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science.

However, language models may lack the ability to\ndetermine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update\nit, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in\nsuboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose\nMem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively\nmanage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also\nconstruct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn\ninteraction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to\nteach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential\ninformation chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update\nthe memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering\naccuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory\nconstruction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we\ndesign a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic\ncomponents, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical\nevaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over\nexisting memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on\ninstances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable\ngeneralization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training\nlength, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha."}

We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly\nacknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,\ncorrect hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks\nand logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks\nwith lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly\nuneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are\noften adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward\nverbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style\nmatters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style\nprompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance.

In this work, we posit that this performance\ndisparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental\ndifference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes\non-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we\nintroduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides\nSFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning\nprocess by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement\nlearning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by\nsampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The\nground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward\nsignal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes\nstatic, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the\ntoken level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while\nbypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive\nexperiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical\nreasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that\nOTR consistently outperforms standard SFT.

Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store\nconsumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the\nmost complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.\nThrough a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable\nflexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario\ntasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from\nmultiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and\nspatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous\ninstructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn\nconversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,\nenabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments\nand stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the\nmost advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and\nless than 50% success rate on others.

However, existing approaches\noften underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically\nfailing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This\nlimitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for\ncontrollable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm\ninspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from\nspeech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a\n``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual\n``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS\nmodel, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To\nrealize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically\nfor this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong\nperformance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming\nstrong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables\nremarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature\ncontrol abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates\nthat objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively\nunlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs."}

In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE\n(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly\ninto the expert ensemble.

However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs)\nprovide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions\naccessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data\ncontamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework\nthat evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key\nidea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG\nwhere nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one\nfunction consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function\nschemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose\nthe correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows\nusers to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth,\nand distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our\nFuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying\ndifficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose\nmodels with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance\ndeclines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected\nirrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong\nmodels often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or\nstale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in\nmulti-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple\nmitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent\nat each step.

LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the\nbenchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English\ntranslation tasks.

Second, self bias in LLM as a\nbenchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the\nsource language.
