Telecommunications\noperation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications\nindustry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,\nand human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified\nservice control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of\nOS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have\nhindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical\nfield. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications\nOperation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this\nbenchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating\nfour key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket\nhandling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To\nsystematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,\nwe categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling\ninto four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic\nNLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we\nleverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10\nopen-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)\nacross diverse scenarios.

As retrieval complexity\nincreases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,\ncurrent RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is\npresented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,\nparticularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This\nraises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect\nmultimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive\nstudy of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled\nexperiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe\na consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To\nquantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and\ndevelop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across\ndecoder layers.

To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks\nand propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition\nstrategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity. Chelsea\nthen merges the KV cache within each cluster into a single centroid.\nAdditionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity\nand the optimality of the intra-chunk partitioning strategy. Extensive\nexperiments across various models and long-context benchmarks demonstrate that\nChelsea achieves up to 80% reduction in KV cache memory usage while maintaining\ncomparable model performance. Moreover, with minimal computational overhead,\nChelsea accelerates the decoding stage of inference by up to 3.19$\\times$ and\nreduces end-to-end latency by up to 2.72$\\times$."}

These settings,\ncharacterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure\nrates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for\neffective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce\nAgent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic\nsettings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by\nhuman pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively\nsteers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse\ninformational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to\ndynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate\na teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces\nand promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In\nthe Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce\ninitial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented\nwith agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy\nis updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.\nAgent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%\nto 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified.

Specifically, through case studies on\nsynthetic tasks, we highlight the critical role of \\textbf{long-short\nalignment} -- the consistency of output distributions across sequences of\nvarying lengths. Extending this insight to natural language tasks, we propose a\nmetric called Long-Short Misalignment to quantify this phenomenon, uncovering a\nstrong correlation between the metric and length generalization performance.\nBuilding on these findings, we develop a regularization term that promotes\nlong-short alignment during training. Extensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness of our approach, offering new insights for achieving more\neffective long-context modeling in LLMs. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/PKU-ML/LongShortAlignment."}

As retrieval complexity\nincreases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,\ncurrent RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is\npresented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,\nparticularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This\nraises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect\nmultimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive\nstudy of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled\nexperiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe\na consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To\nquantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and\ndevelop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across\ndecoder layers.

To bridge this\ngap, this paper introduces a systematic analysis of current evaluation\napproaches, grounded in an evolutionary perspective. We provide a detailed\nanalytical framework that clearly differentiates AI agents from LLM chatbots\nalong five key aspects: complex environment, multi-source instructor, dynamic\nfeedback, multi-modal perception, and advanced capability. Further, we\ncategorize existing evaluation benchmarks based on external environments\ndriving forces, and resulting advanced internal capabilities. For each\ncategory, we delineate relevant evaluation attributes, presented\ncomprehensively in practical reference tables. Finally, we synthesize current\ntrends and outline future evaluation methodologies through four critical\nlenses: environment, agent, evaluator, and metrics. Our findings offer\nactionable guidance for researchers, facilitating the informed selection and\napplication of benchmarks in AI agent evaluation, thus fostering continued\nadvancement in this rapidly evolving research domain."}

Recent\nstudies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma\n7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of\nall tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated\nfine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning\n(ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the\nprinciples of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of\nManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with\nnumerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of\nsolely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the\ncontext as a supervised training target.

Through\nextensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,\nsummarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we\ndemonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning\nand approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning. Furthermore, ManyICL\nsignificantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting issues observed in\nzero/few-shot fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon\npublication."}

These settings,\ncharacterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure\nrates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for\neffective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce\nAgent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic\nsettings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by\nhuman pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively\nsteers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse\ninformational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to\ndynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate\na teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces\nand promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In\nthe Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce\ninitial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented\nwith agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy\nis updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.\nAgent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%\nto 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data\nis additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further\nboosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents\nwith RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods\nstruggle."}

While large language models (LLMs) excel in single-session\ndialogues, they struggle to preserve persona fidelity and conversational\ncoherence across extended interactions. Existing methods typically retrieve\npersona information before response generation, which can constrain diversity\nand result in generic outputs. We propose Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a novel\ntwo-stage framework that reverses this process. PPA first generates a general\nresponse based solely on dialogue context, then retrieves relevant persona\nmemories using the response as a query, and finally refines the response to\nalign with the speaker's persona. This post-hoc alignment strategy promotes\nnaturalness and diversity while preserving consistency and personalization.\nExperiments on multi-session LLM-generated dialogue data demonstrate that PPA\nsignificantly outperforms prior approaches in consistency, diversity, and\npersona relevance, offering a more flexible and effective paradigm for\nlong-term personalized dialogue generation."}

However, it remains unclear how\neffectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In\nan ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would\nexpect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers\nto correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to\nincorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For\neach problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator\nwith access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,\nafter which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse\nrange of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific\nreasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language\nmodels including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,\neven under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show\nresistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To\nmitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like\nprogressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously\nattempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help\nmodels achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of\npotential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model\noverconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in\nLLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in\nself-improvement."}

With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape\nprogramming practices.

In\nthis paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs\non code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability,\nand similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked\nto arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends\nin the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of\nLLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\\_case variable names\nin Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning\nprocesses.
