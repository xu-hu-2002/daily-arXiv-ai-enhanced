This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that\ncombines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning\nstrategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse\nplatforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer\nmodel for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark\nweb pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture\nspecialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns.

The classification pipeline operates in\ntwo stages.

Diverging from critical traditions that conflate\narbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a\nproperty enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate\neffectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand\nde Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this\nprinciple beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,\nparticularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the \"Motivation\n-> Constatability -> Contestability\" chain, arguing that motivation functions\nas a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective\ncontestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like\n\"immotivization\" or \"Conflict Lateralization\" (exemplified by \"the blur of the\nwolf drowned in the fish\"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their\nrationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while\nappearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from\naccountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes\narbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern\ntheory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as\ncare, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily\ndeveloped through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new\npathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence\nsystems."}

In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose\nembedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs\nwithout altering their original architectures or introducing significant\ncomputational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style\nmodel to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is\nthen prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture\ncontextualized information even without attending to future tokens.\nFurthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and\nhelp LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual\ntoken, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as\nthe final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models\ntrained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the\nrequired sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared\nto best-performing methods."}

Graph\nclustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the\ncomplex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces\ninformation redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research\nprogress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational\ngraphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability\nto fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition\nsentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nMRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on\nmulti-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we\nconstruct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse\nrelations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic\nconnections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional\nstructural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically\ndetermining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences\ninto coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression\nmechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative\nsummaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,\nDUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently\noutperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves\nperformance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human\nevaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high\nconsistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality."}

To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC\nand GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical\nreasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math\nproblems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify\nand request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty\nby introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions.\nExperiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models\nexcel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and\ninference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking,\nespecially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning\n(RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm,\nwe achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to\n73.98% on GSM-MC.
