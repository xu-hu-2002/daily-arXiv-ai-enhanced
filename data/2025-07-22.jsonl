However, their use as writing assistants in specialized\ndomains like finance, medicine, and law is often hampered by a lack of deep\ndomain-specific knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. Existing solutions,\nsuch as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can suffer from inconsistency\nacross multiple retrieval steps, while online search-based methods often\ndegrade quality due to unreliable web content. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DeepWriter, a customizable, multimodal, long-form writing assistant\nthat operates on a curated, offline knowledge base. DeepWriter leverages a\nnovel pipeline that involves task decomposition, outline generation, multimodal\nretrieval, and section-by-section composition with reflection. By deeply mining\ninformation from a structured corpus and incorporating both textual and visual\nelements, DeepWriter generates coherent, factually grounded, and\nprofessional-grade documents. We also propose a hierarchical knowledge\nrepresentation to enhance retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our experiments on\nfinancial report generation demonstrate that DeepWriter produces high-quality,\nverifiable articles that surpasses existing baselines in factual accuracy and\ngenerated content quality."}

We perform the first comprehensive analysis of how\nidentity markers present in a user's writing bias LLM responses across five\ndifferent high-stakes LLM applications in the domains of medicine, law,\npolitics, government benefits, and job salaries. We find that LLMs are\nextremely sensitive to markers of identity in user queries and that race,\ngender, and age consistently influence LLM responses in these applications. For\ninstance, when providing medical advice, we find that models apply different\nstandards of care to individuals of different ethnicities for the same\nsymptoms; we find that LLMs are more likely to alter answers to align with a\nconservative (liberal) political worldview when asked factual questions by\nolder (younger) individuals; and that LLMs recommend lower salaries for\nnon-White job applicants and higher salaries for women compared to men.

Although initial\nresults demonstrated multimodal improvements, the statistical significance of\nthese enhancements remained unclear, and there was insufficient guidance on\nleveraging human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis tasks. This workshop\npaper extends the previous research by highlighting that the AudiBERT model not\nonly improved the classification of classes that were sparse in the dataset,\nbut it also had statistically significant class-wise improvements over the BERT\nmodel for classifications in the social-cognitive dimension. However, similar\nsignificant class-wise improvements over the BERT model were not observed for\nclassifications in the affective dimension. A correlation analysis highlighted\nthat larger training data was significantly associated with higher recall\nperformance for both the AudiBERT and BERT models. Additionally, the precision\nof the BERT model was significantly associated with high inter-rater agreement\namong human coders. When employing the BERT model to diagnose indicators within\nthese subskills that were well-detected by the AudiBERT model, the performance\nacross all indicators was inconsistent.

Motivated by the need to understand how the extended long-CoT\nprocess influences long-context comprehension, we conduct a comprehensive\ninvestigation using a series of open-source models distilled from Deepseek-R1,\nrenowned for its exceptional reasoning capabilities. Our study focuses on\nevaluating these models' performance in extracting and integrating relevant\ninformation from extended contexts through multi-document question and\nanswering tasks. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate that\ndistilled reasoning patterns significantly improve long-context understanding.\nOur analysis reveals that distillation fosters greater long-context awareness\nby promoting more detailed and explicit reasoning processes during context\nanalysis and information parsing. This advancement effectively mitigates the\npersistent \"lost in the middle\" issue that has hindered long-context models."}

Although downstream tasks of\ninterest typically do not provide systems with explicit options among which to\nchoose, this approach is nevertheless widely used because it makes it makes\nautomatic grading straightforward and has tended to produce challenging\nbenchmarks that correlate sufficiently well with downstream performance. This\npaper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for\nstate-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of $15$\ndifferent question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HLE) and $25$ different\nLLMs (including small models such as Qwen 7B and relatively large models such\nas Llama 70B). For each model-benchmark pair, we considered $5$ ways of\npresenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple\nchoices were offered to the model at all; whether \"none of the above\" sometimes\nreplaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform\nchain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented. MCQA\nremained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they\nwere allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only before being presented\nwith the options among which they had to select. On the other hand, large\nmodels that were able to perform reasoning after being given a set of options\ntended to significantly outperform their free-text performance due to\nexploiting the information in the options. We conclude that MCQA is no longer a\ngood proxy for assessing downstream performance of state-of-the-art models, and\noffer practical guidelines for designing more robust, bias-resistant benchmarks\nthat better reflect LLMs' genuine reasoning capabilities."}

Project page: https://d223302.github.io/STITCH/", "summary": "Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are designed to take speech inputs and produce\nspoken responses. However, current SLMs lack the ability to perform an\ninternal, unspoken thinking process before responding. In contrast, humans\ntypically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to\ncommunicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking\nfor SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT\nreasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a\nnovel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken\nreasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a\nchunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in\na chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the\nunspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the\nmodel continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving\nsimultaneous thinking and talking. Remarkably, Stitch matches the latency of\nbaselines that cannot generate unspoken CoT by design while outperforming those\nbaselines by 15% on math reasoning datasets; Stitch also performs equally well\non non-reasoning datasets as those baseline models.

We introduce\nBELO (BEnchmarking LLMs for Ophthalmology), a standardized and comprehensive\nevaluation benchmark developed through multiple rounds of expert checking by 13\nophthalmologists. BELO assesses ophthalmology-related clinical accuracy and\nreasoning quality. Using keyword matching and a fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, we\ncurated ophthalmology-specific multiple-choice-questions (MCQs) from diverse\nmedical datasets (BCSC, MedMCQA, MedQA, BioASQ, and PubMedQA). The dataset\nunderwent multiple rounds of expert checking. Duplicate and substandard\nquestions were systematically removed. Ten ophthalmologists refined the\nexplanations of each MCQ's correct answer. This was further adjudicated by\nthree senior ophthalmologists. To illustrate BELO's utility, we evaluated six\nLLMs (OpenAI o1, o3-mini, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-3-8B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro)\nusing accuracy, macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, BERTScore,\nBARTScore, METEOR, and AlignScore). In a further evaluation involving human\nexperts, two ophthalmologists qualitatively reviewed 50 randomly selected\noutputs for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and completeness. BELO consists of 900\nhigh-quality, expert-reviewed questions aggregated from five sources: BCSC\n(260), BioASQ (10), MedMCQA (572), MedQA (40), and PubMedQA (18). A public\nleaderboard has been established to promote transparent evaluation and\nreporting.

To address this gap, we introduce IDRBench -- a pioneering\nbenchmark featuring an expert annotated dataset and a suite of tasks tailored\nto evaluate LLMs' capabilities in proposing valuable research ideas from\ndifferent scientific domains for interdisciplinary research. This benchmark\naims to provide a systematic framework for assessing LLM performance in\ncomplex, cross-domain scientific research. Our dataset consists of scientific\npublications sourced from the ArXiv platform covering six distinct disciplines,\nand is annotated by domain experts with diverse academic backgrounds. To ensure\nhigh-quality annotations, we emphasize clearly defined dimensions that\ncharacterize authentic interdisciplinary research. The design of evaluation\ntasks in IDRBench follows a progressive, real-world perspective, reflecting the\nnatural stages of interdisciplinary research development, including 1) IDR\nPaper Identification, 2) IDR Idea Integration, and 3) IDR Idea Recommendation.\nUsing IDRBench, we construct baselines across 10 LLMs and observe that despite\nfostering some level of IDR awareness, LLMs still struggle to produce quality\nIDR ideas.

Conceived as a simple heuristic quantifying the extent to which a\ngiven term's occurrences are concentrated in any one given document out of\nmany, TF-IDF and its many variants are routinely used as term-weighting schemes\nin diverse text analysis applications. There is a growing body of scholarship\ndedicated to placing TF-IDF on a sound theoretical foundation. Building on that\ntradition, this paper justifies the use of TF-IDF to the statistics community\nby demonstrating how the famed expression can be understood from a significance\ntesting perspective. We show that the common TF-IDF variant TF-ICF is, under\nmild regularity conditions, closely related to the negative logarithm of the\n$p$-value from a one-tailed version of Fisher's exact test of statistical\nsignificance. As a corollary, we establish a connection between TF-IDF and the\nsaid negative log-transformed $p$-value under certain idealized assumptions. We\nfurther demonstrate, as a limiting case, that this same quantity converges to\nTF-IDF in the limit of an infinitely large document collection.

As AI systems engage in extended thinking processes for research\ntasks, meaningful interaction transitions from an optional enhancement to an\nessential component of effective intelligence. Current deep research systems\nadopt an \"input-wait-output\" paradigm where users initiate queries and receive\nresults after black-box processing. This approach leads to error cascade\neffects, inflexible research boundaries that prevent question refinement during\ninvestigation, and missed opportunities for expertise integration. To address\nthese limitations, we introduce Deep Cognition, a system that transforms the\nhuman role from giving instructions to cognitive oversight-a mode of engagement\nwhere humans guide AI thinking processes through strategic intervention at\ncritical junctures. Deep cognition implements three key innovations:\n(1)Transparent, controllable, and interruptible interaction that reveals AI\nreasoning and enables intervention at any point; (2)Fine-grained bidirectional\ndialogue; and (3)Shared cognitive context where the system observes and adapts\nto user behaviors without explicit instruction.

We explore the\nperformance, computational cost and prediction accuracy for both paradigms by\nequally varying the number of trainable parameters for all models. Using a\nconsistent pipeline for all three approaches, we demonstrate that transformers\nexcel in prediction quality, whereas reservoir computers remain highly\nefficient reducing the training and inference speed.
