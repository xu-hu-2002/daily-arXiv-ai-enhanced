Existing multilingual reasoning benchmarks are typically constructed\nby translating existing English reasoning benchmarks, biasing these benchmarks\ntowards reasoning problems with context in English language/cultures. In this\nwork, we introduce the Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC), a\nbenchmark designed to assess LLMs on more than 1,000 native, linguistic and\nculturally grounded reasoning questions written by native speakers in French,\nSpanish, and Chinese. MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories:\nlanguage-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition\nreasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition\nreasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English\nequivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation\nfrom native speakers fluent in English. This set of English equivalents can\nprovide a direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity in other languages vs.\nEnglish on the same reasoning questions. We systematically evaluate current 14\nleading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent\nset. The results show that (1) current LLMs are still not good at native\nmultilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC; (2) LLMs\nexhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses in handling linguistic, cultural, and\nlogical reasoning tasks; (3) Most models perform substantially better in math\nreasoning in English compared to in original languages (+10%), indicating\npersistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge."}

Prior research has shown that intermediate layers contain\nsufficient information to generate accurate answers, leading to the development\nof early-exit algorithms that reduce inference costs by terminating computation\nat earlier layers. However, these methods often suffer from poor performance\ndue to misalignment between intermediate and output layer representations that\nlead to decoding inaccuracy. To address these challenges, we propose SPADE\n(SPace Alignment DEcoding), a novel decoding method that aligns intermediate\nlayer representations with the output layer by propagating a minimally reduced\nsequence consisting of only the start token and the answer token. We further\noptimize the early-exit decision-making process by training a linear\napproximation of SPADE that computes entropy-based confidence metrics. Putting\nthem together, we create a hybrid early-exit algorithm that monitors confidence\nlevels and stops inference at intermediate layers while using SPADE to generate\nhigh-quality outputs. This approach significantly reduces inference costs\nwithout compromising accuracy, offering a scalable and efficient solution for\ndeploying large language models in real-world applications."}

Using LLMs to Identify Negative Campaigning in 18M Tweets across 19 Countries", "comment": null, "summary": "Negative campaigning is a central feature of political competition, yet\nempirical research has been limited by the high cost and limited scalability of\nexisting classification methods. This study makes two key contributions. First,\nit introduces zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel approach for\ncross-lingual classification of negative campaigning. Using benchmark datasets\nin ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with\nnative-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine\nlearning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the\nlargest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18\nmillion tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017\nand 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing\nparties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme\nand populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in\nsignificantly higher levels of negativity. These findings advance our\nunderstanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication\nin multiparty systems. More broadly, the study demonstrates the potential of\nLLMs to enable scalable, transparent, and replicable research in political\ncommunication across linguistic and cultural contexts."}

However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge:\npredicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert\nactivation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address\nthis gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the\ncomputational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a\nlarge-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to\nsystematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural\nconfigurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the\nexpert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following\npredictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator\nwith a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified\nscaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its\nconfiguration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained\nLing-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active\nparameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an\nidentical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance\nof the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources,\nthereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws. This work provides a\nprincipled and empirically-grounded foundation for the scaling of efficient MoE\nmodels."}

We propose a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that\ntransforms any existing QA dataset into structured adversarial debates--where\none model is given the official answer to defend, and another constructs and\ndefends an alternative answer--adjudicated by a judge model blind to the\ncorrect solution. By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach\nsubstantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet\nreuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions:\n(1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based\nassessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's\neffectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized\nprotocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of\nthe method and its effectiveness against data contamination--a Llama 3.1 model\nfine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% -> 82%)\nbut performed worse in debates.
