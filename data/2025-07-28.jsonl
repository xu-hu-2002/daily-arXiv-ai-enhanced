We introduce\nSpecification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables\nan LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC\nemploys a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a\nresponse based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output,\nand then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A\nfinal, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected\nspecification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding\ntasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted\nspecifications in 50-70\\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability\nby over 90\\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight\nmodification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior.

With a focus on gender and\nprofessional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to\nungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a\nstructured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three\ndifferent professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a\nhierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive\ngrammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current\nLLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular\nLLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google\nGemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600\nresponses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate\nstereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she'\npronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in\nAI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in\nthe workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use.\nUnderstanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and\nassuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather\ncontribute to more equitable outcomes.

However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks\ndue to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused\non enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural\ninnovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match\nthe performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that\nthis limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not\nwell-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a\nchunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth\nReading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual\ninformation, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more\ncompatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method\nsubstantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention\nLLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of\nRecurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from\n5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.\nBesides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and\ninferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using\nRecurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks.
