However, the current landscape supports\nonly a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing\nones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the\nmathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their\nimplementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch\ncreates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual\nbridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in\nformal methods, high-performance computing, etc.\n  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level\nspecifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level\nimplementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based\nintermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit\ntensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During\nlifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to\nperform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific\noptimizations as rewrites.

To address these\nissues, we introduce the concept of an intention tree and propose a dataset\ncuration pipeline.

To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,\nfinetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression\nlevels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and\nhidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning\nlevels.

We validate the MediQAl dataset through extensive evaluation with\n14 large language models, including recent reasoning-augmented models, and\nobserve a significant performance gap between factual recall and reasoning\ntasks. Our evaluation provides a comprehensive benchmark for assessing language\nmodels' performance on French medical question answering, addressing a crucial\ngap in multilingual resources for the medical domain."}

To\nhelp address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks\n(EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international\nbenchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and\nclassify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our\nsolutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism\nIdentification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask\n1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address\neach subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck\nModel (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a\nfine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as\nhuman-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models\n(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of\nadjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.\nSCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual\nembeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification\nperformance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained\nexplanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also\ninvestigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles,\ncan be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data\naugmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for\nEnglish in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and\nSpanish and 6th for Spanish."}

This work presents an effective approach for detecting and\nediting factually incorrect content in model-generated responses based on the\nprovided context. Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we\nconstruct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial\nquestion-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4,\nPhi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual\ninaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8%\nimprovement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance\ncompared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having\nonly 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2%\ndrop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to\nOpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing\nfactual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a\ngeneralizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of\nlarge language models across diverse applications beyond finance.

This paper investigates the ``diversity gap'' for a writing prompt\nnarrative generation task. This gap emerges as measured by current diversity\nmetrics for various open-weight and open-source LLMs. The results show\nsignificant decreases in diversity due to instruction-tuning. We explore the\ndiversity loss at each fine-tuning stage for the OLMo and OLMo 2 models to\nfurther understand how output diversity is affected. The results indicate that\nDPO has the most substantial impact on diversity. Motivated by these findings,\nwe present a new decoding strategy, conformative decoding, which guides an\ninstruct model using its more diverse base model to reintroduce output\ndiversity. We show that conformative decoding typically increases diversity and\neven maintains or improves quality."}

We examine how different aspects of the\nfine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data,\nusing the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.\n  Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to\ndetect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess\nverbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight\nmatrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity\nand memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation\n(LoRA) fine-tuning.\n  Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more\nsignificantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower\nperplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3)\nHigher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns\nat higher ranks.\n  These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance\nand privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for\ndeveloping more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large\nlanguage models while managing data privacy concerns."}

As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and\ncostly, the emerging \"LLM-as-a-judge\" paradigm sheds light on a promising\napproach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet,\nto date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona\ndescriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are\nnot generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose\nMAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically\nconstruct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant\ntext documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the\npersonas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate\nmulti-dimensional feedback. Our evaluation experiments in both the educational\nand medical domains demonstrate that MAJ-EVAL can generate evaluation results\nthat better align with human experts' ratings compared with conventional\nautomated evaluation metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods."}
