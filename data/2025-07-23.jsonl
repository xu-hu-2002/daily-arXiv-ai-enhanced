Designed and\nimplemented by eSapiens, the system ingests heterogeneous content (PDF, Office,\nweb), splits it into 1,000-token overlapping chunks, and indexes them in a\nhybrid HNSW+BM25 store. User queries are refined by GPT-4o, retrieved via\ncombined vector+BM25 search, reranked with Cohere, and answered by an LLM using\nCO-STAR prompt engineering. A LangGraph verifier enforces citation overlap,\nregenerating answers until every claim is grounded. On four LegalBench subsets,\n1000-token chunks improve Recall@50 by approximately 1 pp and hybrid+rerank\nboosts Precision@10 by approximately 7 pp; the verifier raises TRACe\nUtilization above 0.50 and limits unsupported statements to less than 3%.

In fact, the prevalent large proprietary models\ncould hardly generate verifiable programs. A promising yet largely uncharted\nalternative is formal language-based reasoning. Grounding LLMs in rigorous\nformal systems where generative models operate in formal language spaces (e.g.,\nDafny) enables the automatic and mathematically provable verification of their\nreasoning processes and outcomes. This capability is pivotal for achieving\nlarge-scale, reliable formal software verification. It is a common practice to\nemploy human-annotated chain-of-thought and other human priors to induce the\nreasoning and coding capabilities of LLMs. Unfortunately, it becomes\nunacceptably all-consuming to provide such priors for supervising complex\nprogramming tasks. In this work, we systematically explore ways to reduce human\npriors with the formal language, Dafny, as the main environment for our pilot\nstudy. Our pipeline mainly relies on introducing an automatic and scalable data\ncuration pipeline, and careful RL designs integrated with feedback from the\nformal language verifier.

However, LLMs' comprehension of input prompts remains agnostic, limiting\nICA's ability to address value tensions--human values are inherently\npluralistic, often imposing conflicting demands, e.g., stimulation vs.\ntradition. Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck\nchallenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a\nsingle prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment. To address this, we\npropose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method. Without fine-tuning, PICACO\noptimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit\nLLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by\nmaximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses,\ntheoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise,\nresulting in effective value instructions. Extensive experiments on five value\nsets show that PICACO works well with both black-box and open-source LLMs,\noutperforms several recent strong baselines, and achieves a better balance\nacross up to 8 distinct values."}

However,\nexisting evaluation frameworks fail to align well with the goals of agentic\nsearch. First, the complex queries commonly used in current benchmarks often\ndeviate from realistic user search scenarios. Second, prior approaches tend to\nintroduce noise when extracting ground truth for end-to-end evaluations,\nleading to distorted assessments at a fine-grained level. Third, most current\nframeworks focus solely on the quality of final answers, neglecting the\nevaluation of the iterative process inherent to agentic search.
