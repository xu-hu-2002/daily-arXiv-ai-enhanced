We challenge this assumption by\ndemonstrating that excessive representational entanglement with a dominant\nvariety, such as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in relation to Arabic dialects,\ncan actively hinder generative modeling. We present the first comprehensive\ncausal study of this phenomenon by analyzing and directly intervening in the\ninternal representation geometry of large language models (LLMs). Our key\ncontribution is an online variational probing framework that continuously\nestimates the subspace of the standard variety during fine-tuning, enabling\nprojection-based decoupling from this space. While our study uses Arabic as a\ncase due to its unusually rich parallel resources across 25 dialects, the\nbroader motivation is methodological: dialectal MT serves as a controlled proxy\nfor generative tasks where comparable multi-variety corpora are unavailable.\nAcross 25 dialects, our intervention improves generation quality by up to +4.9\nchrF++ and +2.0 on average compared to standard fine-tuning, despite a measured\ntradeoff in standard-language performance. These results provide causal\nevidence that subspace dominance by high-resource varieties can restrict\ngenerative capacity for related varieties. More generally, we unify geometric\nand information-theoretic probing with subspace-level causal interventions,\noffering practical tools for improving generative modeling in closely related\nlanguage families and, more broadly, for controlling representational\nallocation in multilingual and multi-domain LLMs. Code will be released."}

There has been a\nsubstantial body of research developing models for determining if a social\nmedia post is abusive or not; however, this research has primarily focused on\nexploiting social media posts individually, overlooking additional context that\ncan be derived from surrounding posts. In this study, we look at conversational\nexchanges, where a user replies to an earlier post by another user (the parent\ntweet). We ask: does leveraging context from the parent tweet help determine if\na reply post is abusive or not, and what are the features that contribute the\nmost? We study a range of content-based and account-based features derived from\nthe context, and compare this to the more widely studied approach of only\nlooking at the features from the reply tweet. For a more generalizable study,\nwe test four different classification models on a dataset made of\nconversational exchanges (parent-reply tweet pairs) with replies labeled as\nabusive or not. Our experiments show that incorporating contextual features\nleads to substantial improvements compared to the use of features derived from\nthe reply tweet only, confirming the importance of leveraging context. We\nobserve that, among the features under study, it is especially the\ncontent-based features (what is being posted) that contribute to the\nclassification performance rather than account-based features (who is posting\nit). While using content-based features, it is best to combine a range of\ndifferent features to ensure improved performance over being more selective and\nusing fewer features.

To tackle the challenge of poor reasoning in Small Language Models\n(SLMs), existing methods typically leverage LLMs to generate massive amounts of\ndata for cramming training. In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking,\nwhich resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition.\nHowever, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is\nfirst acquired and then reinforced through practice. Inspired by such two\ndistinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA\nInteraction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). First, we input\nthe question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create\nknowledge-enhanced datasets.

Then, to imitate System 2 thinking, we train the Knowledge\nGenerator (KG) and Deep Reasoner (DR), respectively. The former outputs only\nknowledge after receiving problems, while the latter uses that knowledge to\nperform reasoning. Finally, to address the randomness in the generation of IR\nand DR, we evaluate whether their outputs are consistent, and the inference\nprocess needs to be iterated if not.

The bias is then\nquantified using two metrics: Fidelity Gap (the JS Divergence between\ndistributions) and Coverage (the percentage of source labels omitted). Using\nBlindSpot, we conducted an empirical study with 2500 real call transcripts and\ntheir summaries generated by 20 LLMs of varying scales and families (e.g., GPT,\nLlama, Claude). Our analysis reveals that biases are systemic and present\nacross all evaluated models, regardless of size or family."}

While substantial progress has been made in\nEnglish, the task remains underexplored in Arabic, particularly given its rich\nlinguistic diversity. Existing Arabic resources have primarily focused on\nModern Standard Arabic (MSA), leaving regional dialects underrepresented\ndespite their prevalence in spoken contexts. To bridge this gap, we present two\nkey contributions: (i) we introduce MuDRiC, an extended Arabic commonsense\ndataset incorporating multiple dialects, and (ii) a novel method adapting Graph\nConvolutional Networks (GCNs) to Arabic commonsense reasoning, which enhances\nsemantic relationship modeling for improved commonsense validation. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves superior\nperformance in Arabic commonsense validation. Our work enhances Arabic natural\nlanguage understanding by providing both a foundational dataset and a novel\nmethod for handling its complex variations.

The strength of a watermark\ntypically depends strongly on the entropy afforded by the language model and\nthe set of input prompts. However, entropy can be quite limited in practice,\nespecially for models that are post-trained, for example via instruction tuning\nor reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which makes detection\nbased on watermarking alone challenging. In this work, we investigate whether\ndetection can be improved by combining watermark detectors with non-watermark\nones. We explore a number of hybrid schemes that combine the two, observing\nperformance gains over either class of detector under a wide range of\nexperimental conditions."}

This has led to the\ndevelopment of separate thinking and non-thinking LLM variants, leaving the\nonus of selecting the optimal model for each query on the end user. In this\nwork, we introduce OptimalThinkingBench, a unified benchmark that jointly\nevaluates overthinking and underthinking in LLMs and also encourages the\ndevelopment of optimally-thinking models that balance performance and\nefficiency. Our benchmark comprises two sub-benchmarks: OverthinkingBench,\nfeaturing simple queries in 72 domains, and UnderthinkingBench, containing 11\nchallenging reasoning tasks. Using novel thinking-adjusted accuracy metrics, we\nperform extensive evaluation of 33 different thinking and non-thinking models\nand show that no model is able to optimally think on our benchmark. Thinking\nmodels often overthink for hundreds of tokens on the simplest user queries\nwithout improving performance. In contrast, large non-thinking models\nunderthink, often falling short of much smaller thinking models. We further\nexplore several methods to encourage optimal thinking, but find that these\napproaches often improve on one sub-benchmark at the expense of the other,\nhighlighting the need for better unified and optimal models in the future."}

Smith", "Hannaneh Hajishirzi", "Kyle Lo", "Jesse Dodge"], "title": "Signal and Noise: A Framework for Reducing Uncertainty in Language Model Evaluation", "comment": null, "summary": "Developing large language models is expensive and involves making decisions\nwith small experiments, typically by evaluating on large, multi-task evaluation\nsuites. In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark\nmore reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality\nevaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in\ncurrent benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models\nfrom worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability\nbetween training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better\nsignal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,\nand those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These\nresults suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful\nbenchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect\nsignal or noise. For example, we propose that switching to a metric that has\nbetter signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better\nreliability and improved scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy\nsubtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable\nmulti-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's\nintermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements. We\nconclude by recommending that those creating new benchmarks, or selecting which\nexisting benchmarks to use, aim for high signal and low noise. We use 30\nbenchmarks for these experiments, and 375 open-weight language models from 60M\nto 32B parameters, resulting in a new, publicly available dataset of 900K\nevaluation benchmark results, totaling 200M instances."}

This version is a pre-MIT Press publication\n  version", "summary": "Detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for\npreventing misuse and building trustworthy AI systems. Although existing\ndetection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD)\nscenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to\nfeatures used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of\nLLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively\ncapture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between\nLLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this\nhypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural\nactivation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we\npropose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.\nSpecifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of\nLGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better\nidentify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of\nthe text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a\nprecomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms\nall baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD\nscenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and\nmainstream attacks.
