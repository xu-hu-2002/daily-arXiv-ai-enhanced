A key obstacle lies in the complexity\nand variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often\nappear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting\ndetails. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core\nproblem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that\nunderstanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,\nparticularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a\nnew framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural\nlanguage problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet\nexpressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized\ninputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce\nDURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a\nthree-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems\nvia reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through\nself-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space.

Given the LLM's diminished reasoning\nover extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches\nremain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall\nshort due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often\noverlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within\nlong-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle\nthat narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving\ninterplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,\nanalogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the\nbrain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes\niterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.\nIn each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,\nthen integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory\npool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query\nresolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+\ntokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative\ngains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals\nthat ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global\ncomprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for\nretrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning.

In this work, we\nintroduce IdiomEval, a framework with a comprehensive error taxonomy for\nChinese idiom translation. We annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern\nsystems, including GPT-4o and Google Translate, across four domains: web, news,\nWikipedia, and social media. We find these systems fail at idiom translation,\nproducing incorrect, literal, partial, or even missing translations. The\nbest-performing system, GPT-4, makes errors in 28% of cases.

On GLUE (MNLI, STS-B, CoLA) and WikiText-103, the method\nyields a family of models that trace a Pareto frontier and consistently\ndominate post-hoc pruning; for a similar accuracy we obtain roughly a forty\npercent reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, together with more interpretable\nattention patterns.

While prior work\nhas acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it\nto data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first\nsystematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,\nincluding images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this\nimbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index\n(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis\nreveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested\nmodalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention\ndilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence\nof fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor\ntextual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that\neffectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for\ninstance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of\n0.86.
