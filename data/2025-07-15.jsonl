In this work, we introduce Spatial ModernBERT-a transformer-based\nmodel augmented with spatial embeddings-to accurately detect and extract\ntabular data and key-value fields from complex financial documents. We cast the\nextraction task as token classification across three heads: (1) Label Head,\nclassifying each token as a label (e.g., PO Number, PO Date, Item Description,\nQuantity, Base Cost, MRP, etc.); (2) Column Head, predicting column indices;\n(3) Row Head, distinguishing the start of item rows and header rows. The model\nis pretrained on the PubTables-1M dataset, then fine-tuned on a financial\ndocument dataset, achieving robust performance through cross-entropy loss on\neach classification head. We propose a post-processing method to merge tokens\nusing B-I-IB tagging, reconstruct the tabular layout, and extract key-value\npairs. Empirical evaluation shows that Spatial ModernBERT effectively leverages\nboth textual and spatial cues, facilitating highly accurate table and key-value\nextraction in real-world financial documents."}

While recent\nLLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection\naccuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''),\nthey struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM\nsystems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource\nlanguages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a\nmultilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse\nlanguages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing\nguardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in\nLLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model\ninto a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct\nSEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over\n260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.\nWe evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on\nthis benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak\nprompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art\nLlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and\n18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In\ncontrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual\nunsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and\nachieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further\nreveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the\noverall performance of SEALGuard. SEALGuard advances the safety alignment of\nLLM systems by introducing an effective multilingual guardrail."}

Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic\nattention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while\npreserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are\noften limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating\nmechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent\nstate-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports\nconstant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more\nflexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global\ncontext compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,\nforming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and\nfine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware\nalgorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models.

We\nprovide both a quantitative analysis and qualitative insights into how the\nmodels respond to increasing noise in the user prompt.\n  The prompt quality strongly affects the translation performance: With many\nerrors, even a good prompt can underperform a minimal or poor prompt without\nerrors.

In this work, we\napproach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3,\n2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function\nas a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as\npath patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their\nnotable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a\nfunction induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from\nstandard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the\nstructure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it\nto a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1\nfunction is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which\nemits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function\ninduction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic\ntasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8\naddition. Overall, our findings offer deeper insights into how reusable and\ncomposable structures within language models enable task-level generalization."}

Stylometric metrics work well on\nautoregressive (AR) outputs, but their effectiveness on diffusion-based models\nis unknown. We present the first systematic comparison of diffusion-generated\ntext (LLaDA) and AR-generated text (LLaMA) using 2 000 samples. Perplexity,\nburstiness, lexical diversity, readability, and BLEU/ROUGE scores show that\nLLaDA closely mimics human text in perplexity and burstiness, yielding high\nfalse-negative rates for AR-oriented detectors. LLaMA shows much lower\nperplexity but reduced lexical fidelity. Relying on any single metric fails to\nseparate diffusion outputs from human writing. We highlight the need for\ndiffusion-aware detectors and outline directions such as hybrid models,\ndiffusion-specific stylometric signatures, and robust watermarking."}

We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework\nthat combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.\nMoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter\nefficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by\ndynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This\nallows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still\nactive at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency\nby selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core\nmechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the\nfirst recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory\nfootprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms\na new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it\nsignificantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy,\nwhile delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive\nbaselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards\nlarge-model quality without incurring large-model cost."}

Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also\nserve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by\nother models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking\ndifferent LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.\nHowever, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its\neffectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of\ndedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a\nbenchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and\nunit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform\nnon-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even\nrelatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially\ntrained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still\nexhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise\njudging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can\nsubstantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests\nwritten by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in\nperformance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and\nconsistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal\nprompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise\ncomparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining\ncomments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved\njudge performance."}

Existing benchmarks predominantly assess\nsingle-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical\nlimitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging\n(e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly and perpetual\ncreation of new questions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate\nmodels under multi-context pressure, a key requirement for real-world\ndeployment. To bridge this gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through\nSimultaneous Testing), a stress-testing framework that concurrently exposes\nLRMs to multiple problems simultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST\nspecifically evaluates several under-tested capabilities: contextual priority\nallocation, cross-problem interference resistance, and dynamic cognitive load\nmanagement. Our evaluation reveals several striking findings: Even\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit substantial performance\ndegradation under stress testing. Crucially, REST demonstrates stronger\ndiscriminative power than existing benchmarks, revealing pronounced performance\ndifferences among models that exhibit similar, near-ceiling performance under\nsingle-question evaluations. Some key mechanistic insights emerge from our\nanalysis: (1) the \"overthinking trap\" is a critical factor contributing to the\nperformance degradation; (2) the models trained with \"long2short\" technique\npreserve more accuracy of their single-problem performance under REST,\noutperforming standard-trained counterparts. These results establish REST as a\ncost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm that better reflects\nreal-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on continuous human\nannotation."}
