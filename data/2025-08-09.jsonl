To address this specific\nvulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought\n(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive\nVerification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective\nSelf-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score\nfunction I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the\nreasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and\nprioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are\nidentified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the\nfailure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH\ndemonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong\nbaselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of\ndiagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift\nfrom uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware\ncorrection mechanisms."}

Prior\nresearch on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over\nreview reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a\ndecision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing\nthem within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that\ndecision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue\nagents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for\nrealizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,\nwe first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by\ngenerating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a\nself-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert\ndomains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality\nsynthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training\nmeta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue\nagents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform\n\\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task.

Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous\nphysical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios\nspanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals\nsevere performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while\nachieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to\n56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound\ntasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental\ninformation degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter\ntask-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically\n(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing\nfundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied\nreasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can\naddress, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and\nadvancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the\nsupplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance."}

However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a\nkey component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting\nposes several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification\nmethods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks\nsuch as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we\nfind that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to\nreward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant\nresponses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the\nfactual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies\nonline RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form\nfactuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average\nreduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in\nanswer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness."}

Linear Probes Can Uncover Persuasion Dynamics in Multi-Turn Conversations", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to\npersuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is\nlimited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing\nmodel representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model\nuser sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to\nstudy persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage\ninsights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of\npersuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.\nDespite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of\npersuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can\nidentify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where\npersuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show\nthat in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,\nprobes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such\nas when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible\navenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and\nmanipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset\nanalysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient."}

On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art\nresults: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better\ncompression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ\ncorruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries.
