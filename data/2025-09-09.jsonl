Central to the proposed approach are innovative context matrix\ncomputation methods, designed to create unique, representations of words based\non their surrounding linguistic context. Five distinct methods are proposed and\ntested for computing the context matrices, incorporating techniques such as\nexponential decay, sinusoidal modulation, phase shifts, and hash-based\ntransformations.

However, the effectiveness of cross-attention is affected by\nvariations in biasing information volume, especially when the length of the\nbiasing list increases significantly. We find that, regardless of the length of\nthe biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant\nto a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and\nintegrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire\nbiasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information\nvolume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic\ncorrelation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and\ncalculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate\nrepresentations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level,\nphrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled\nto produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information\nacross various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual\nrecognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the\njoint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification\nmechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant\nbiasing phrases.

Among these, Greedy Coordinate\nGradient (GCG) has emerged as a general and effective approach that optimizes\nthe tokens in a suffix to generate jailbreakable prompts. While several\nimproved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length\nsuffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains\nunexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that\nemploys learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix.\nOur approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact\npositions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only\nreduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby\nlowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve\nsuccessful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the\noriginal GCG and several improved variants.

We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of\nstate-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs, providing a foundational\nassessment of their trade-offs in reliability, operational efficiency, and\nmodel calibration. Our results quantify a clear performance hierarchy,\nidentifying top models that exhibit high alignment with a benchmark standard\nand trustworthy, well-calibrated confidence scores. We also demonstrate that\nclassification performance is highly dependent on the task's semantic\nambiguity, with all models showing higher consensus on objective component\nidentification than on interpretive maintenance actions. Given that no model\nachieves perfect accuracy and that calibration varies dramatically, we conclude\nthat the most effective and responsible near-term application is a\nHuman-in-the-Loop system, where LLMs act as a powerful assistant to accelerate\nand standardise data labelling for human experts, thereby enhancing O&M data\nquality and downstream reliability analysis."}

Pruning is a key technique toward this goal. However, prior pruning\nmethods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout\nor requires custom inference code, while depth pruning removes entire layers\nand can cause abrupt accuracy drops. In this work, we propose COMPACT, which\njointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding and (ii)\nprunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations,\naligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT enjoys\nmerits of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps\na standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab vs. FFN\npruning), training-free operation with competitive pruning time, and strong\nmemory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and\nGemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream task performance at\nsimilar or higher pruning ratios, with substantial reductions in parameters,\nGPU memory, and end-to-end latency."}

Careful alignment of training\ndata and culturally grounded evaluation criteria are vital for developing\nresponsible AI systems. In this study, we introduce the EPT (Evaluation of\nPersian Trustworthiness) metric, a culturally informed benchmark specifically\ndesigned to assess the trustworthiness of LLMs across six key aspects:\ntruthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and ethical alignment. We\ncurated a labeled dataset and evaluated the performance of several leading\nmodels - including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, and\nQwen - using both automated LLM-based and human assessments. Our results reveal\nsignificant deficiencies in the safety dimension, underscoring the urgent need\nfor focused attention on this critical aspect of model behavior.

While\nmost prior work relies on simple majority voting or reward model ranking to\naggregate solutions, these approaches may only yield limited benefits. In this\nwork, we propose to learn aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill: given a\nset of candidate solutions, we train an aggregator model to review, reconcile,\nand synthesize a final, correct answer using reinforcement learning from\nverifiable rewards. A key ingredient is careful balancing of easy and hard\ntraining examples, allowing the model to learn both to recover\nminority-but-correct answers as well as easy majority-correct answers.\nEmpirically, we find our method, AggLM, outperforms both strong rule-based and\nreward-model baselines, across multiple benchmarks.

To build\nmmBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio\nschedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio.

We propose\n\\textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that\nenforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric\nspans are emitted as \\emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a\nverifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality,\nrounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places\nverification in the \\emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers\nare marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation\nprevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and\nprove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and\nmonotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,\nintegrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with\ncryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before\ndisplay, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings:\n\\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates\nuncertainty."}

This study introduces a novel method for\nlearning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate\nbetter cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT\nobjective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how\nto guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs\nRL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level\nexplicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint\nSFT-RL training over RL alone.
