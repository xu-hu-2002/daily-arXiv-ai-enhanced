Using a 10,000-article Wikipedia corpus, we trained models under\nlow-resource conditions and evaluated them on a Named Entity Recognition (NER)\ntask.

The aim is to\nreconceptualize prompting not as a technical input mechanism but as a\ncommunicative and epistemic act involving an iterative process of sign\nformation, interpretation, and refinement. The theoretical foundation rests on\nPeirce's semiotics, particularly the interplay between representamen, object,\nand interpretant, and the typological richness of signs: qualisign, sinsign,\nlegisign; icon, index, symbol; rheme, dicent, argument - alongside the\ninterpretant triad captured in the Dynacom model. Analytically, the paper\npositions the LLM as a semiotic resource that generates interpretants in\nresponse to user prompts, thereby participating in meaning-making within shared\nuniverses of discourse. The findings suggest that prompting is a semiotic and\ncommunicative process that redefines how knowledge is organized, searched,\ninterpreted, and co-constructed in digital environments.

LLMs tend to\ngenerate hallucinations, a seemingly plausible yet factually unsupported output\n[Hua+24], which have serious real-world consequences [Kay23; Rum+24]. Recent\nwork has shown that probing-based classifiers that utilize LLMs' internal\nrepresentations can detect hallucinations [AM23; Bei+24; Bur+24; DYT24; Ji+24;\nSMZ24; Su+24]. This approach, since it does not involve model training, can\nenhance reliability without significantly increasing computational costs.\n  Building upon this approach, this thesis proposed novel methods for\nhallucination detection using LLM internal representations and evaluated them\nacross three benchmarks: TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and ReFact. Specifically, a new\narchitecture that dynamically weights and combines internal LLM layers was\ndeveloped to improve hallucination detection performance.

Second,\nthese generalization limitations were demonstrated to be mitigated through\ncross-benchmark training and parameter freezing. While not consistently\nimproving, both techniques yielded better performance on individual benchmarks\nand reduced performance degradation when transferred to other benchmarks. These\nfindings open new avenues for improving LLM reliability through internal\nrepresentation analysis."}

To study this phenomenon, Deshpande et al. (2023)\nproposed the Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) task and annotated\na human-rated similarity dataset containing pairs of sentences compared under\ntwo different conditions. However, Tu et al. (2024) found various annotation\nissues in this dataset and showed that manually re-annotating a small portion\nof it leads to more accurate C-STS models. Despite these pioneering efforts,\nthe lack of large and accurately annotated C-STS datasets remains a blocker for\nmaking progress on this task as evidenced by the subpar performance of the\nC-STS models. To address this training data need, we resort to Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to correct the condition statements and similarity ratings in the\noriginal dataset proposed by Deshpande et al. (2023). Our proposed method is\nable to re-annotate a large training dataset for the C-STS task with minimal\nmanual effort. Importantly, by training a supervised C-STS model on our cleaned\nand re-annotated dataset, we achieve a 5.4% statistically significant\nimprovement in Spearman correlation. The re-annotated dataset is available at\nhttps://LivNLP.github.io/CSTS-reannotation."}

Our approach covers both the direct use of base LLMs\nand the fine-tuning of models, an alternative that can yield substantial\nperformance gains in certain scenarios.

With the recent rise of generative large\nlanguage models (LLMs), there has been a corresponding rise in the number of\npapers that apply LLMs to de-identification.

This is achieved through three\ncore innovations: (1) decoupled learning of the direction and magnitude for\nLoRA adapters, (2) a shared learnable magnitude vector for consistent\nactivation scaling, and (3) expert selection loss that encourages divergent\nexpert activation.

Existing\nstudies primarily formulate OpenRE as a clustering task. They first cluster all\ntest instances based on the similarity between the instances, and then manually\nassign a new relation to each cluster. However, their reliance on human\nannotation limits their practicality. In this paper, we propose an OpenRE\nframework based on large language models (LLMs), which directly predicts new\nrelations for test instances by leveraging their strong language understanding\nand generation abilities, without human intervention. Specifically, our\nframework consists of two core components: (1) a relation discoverer (RD),\ndesigned to predict new relations for test instances based on\n\\textit{demonstrations} formed by training instances with known relations; and\n(2) a relation predictor (RP), used to select the most likely relation for a\ntest instance from $n$ candidate relations, guided by \\textit{demonstrations}\ncomposed of their instances. To enhance the ability of our framework to predict\nnew relations, we design a self-correcting inference strategy composed of three\nstages: relation discovery, relation denoising, and relation prediction. In the\nfirst stage, we use RD to preliminarily predict new relations for all test\ninstances. Next, we apply RP to select some high-reliability test instances for\neach new relation from the prediction results of RD through a cross-validation\nmethod. During the third stage, we employ RP to re-predict the relations of all\ntest instances based on the demonstrations constructed from these reliable test\ninstances. Extensive experiments on three OpenRE datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework. We release our code at\nhttps://github.com/XMUDeepLIT/LLM-OREF.git."}

We use model-internal representations to tap directly\ninto the way Large Language Models represent the 'grammatical-ungrammatical'\ndistinction. In a novel benchmark, we elicit probabilities from 4 models and\ncompute minimal-pair surprisal differences, juxtaposing probabilities assigned\nto grammatical sentences to probabilities assigned to (i) lower frequency\ngrammatical sentences, (ii) ungrammatical sentences, (iii) semantically odd\nsentences, and (iv) pragmatically odd sentences. The prediction is that if\nstring-probabilities can function as proxies for the limits of grammar, the\nungrammatical condition will stand out among the conditions that involve\nlinguistic violations, showing a spike in the surprisal rates.
