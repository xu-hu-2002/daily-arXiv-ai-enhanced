However, there is no clearly\nestablished methodology for effective training data selection. Simply\nincreasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,\nwhile preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and\ncost.\n  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been\nproposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable\ntraining data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods\ntypically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and\nincurring additional costs for prompt design.\n  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal\nRepresentations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by\nanalyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes\nsimilarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final\nhidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that\nwere largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide\nrange of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.\nMoreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity\nwith the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.\nExperiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less\nfamiliar data leads to better generalization performance."}

In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training\nframework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for\nvarying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five\npersonality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that\ncombines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual\ntrait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially\noutperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional\nintelligence.
