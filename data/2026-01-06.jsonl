Manuscript submitted for peer-reviewed journal publication", "summary": "A central challenge in social science is to generate rich qualitative hypotheses about how diverse social groups might interpret new information. This article introduces and illustrates a novel methodological approach for this purpose: sociological persona simulation using Large Language Models (LLMs), which we frame as a \"qualitative laboratory\". We argue that for this specific task, persona simulation offers a distinct advantage over established methods. By generating naturalistic discourse, it overcomes the lack of discursive depth common in vignette surveys, and by operationalizing complex worldviews through natural language, it bypasses the formalization bottleneck of rule-based agent-based models (ABMs). To demonstrate this potential, we present a protocol where personas derived from a sociological theory of climate reception react to policy messages. The simulation produced nuanced and counter-intuitive hypotheses - such as a conservative persona's rejection of a national security frame - that challenge theoretical assumptions. We conclude that this method, used as part of a \"simulation then validation\" workflow, represents a superior tool for generating deeply textured hypotheses for subsequent empirical testing."}

We study compressed query delegation (CQD): (i) compress a high-dimensional latent reasoning state into a low-rank tensor query, (ii) delegate the minimal query to an external oracle, and (iii) update the latent state via Riemannian optimization on fixed-rank manifolds. We give a math-first formulation: CQD is a constrained stochastic program with a query-budget functional and an oracle modeled as a noisy operator. We connect CQD to classical rate-distortion and information bottleneck principles, showing that spectral hard-thresholding is optimal for a natural constrained quadratic distortion problem, and we derive convergence guarantees for Riemannian stochastic approximation under bounded oracle noise and smoothness assumptions. Empirically, we report (A) a 2,500-item bounded-context reasoning suite (BBH-derived tasks plus curated paradox instances) comparing CQD against chain-of-thought baselines under fixed compute and context; and (B) a human \"cognitive mirror\" benchmark (N=200) measuring epistemic gain and semantic drift across modern oracles."}

We call this process intention collapse: a many-to-one projection from a high dimensional intention space I into an external language space L. We formalize intention collapse for contemporary language models, define three simple, model agnostic intention metrics (intention entropy Hint, effective dimensionality dimeff, and latent knowledge recoverability Recov), and propose an empirical agenda for studying how inference time computation shapes internal intentions before they are verbalized. We also report a first small scale experiment. Using a 4 bit Mistral 7B model on 200 GSM8K problems, we compare a direct answer baseline, a chain of thought (CoT) regime, and a babble control. CoT raises accuracy from 5.5 percent to 53 percent, sharply reduces pre collapse intention entropy (from 1.42 to 0.37 bits), and shows higher global effective dimensionality than the other regimes despite producing fewer tokens than babble. At the same time, Hint has little item level predictive power, and a linear probe on I achieves AUROC 0.65 in the CoT regime but only about chance in the baseline regime, where it collapses to the majority class. These preliminary results indicate that intention level metrics can distinguish inference regimes and expose latent information that is partly lost during collapse, while also revealing important limitations of our current proxies"}

While existing language model-based methods achieve remarkable performance by combining offline column representation learning with online ranking, their design insufficiently accounts for the underlying structural interactions: (1) offline, they directly model tables into isolated or pairwise columns, thereby struggling to capture the rich inter-table and intra-table structural information; and (2) online, they rank candidate columns based solely on query-candidate similarity, ignoring the mutual interactions among the candidates, leading to incoherent result sets. To address these limitations, we propose HyperJoin, a large language model (LLM)-augmented Hypergraph framework for Joinable table discovery. Specifically, we first construct a hypergraph to model tables using both the intra-table hyperedges and the LLM-augmented inter-table hyperedges. Consequently, the task of joinable table discovery is formulated as link prediction on this constructed hypergraph. We then design HIN, a Hierarchical Interaction Network that learns expressive column representations through bidirectional message passing over columns and hyperedges. To strengthen coherence and internal consistency in the result columns, we cast online ranking as a coherence-aware top-k column selection problem. We then introduce a reranking module that leverages a maximum spanning tree algorithm to prune noisy connections and maximize coherence. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of HyperJoin, achieving average improvements of 21.4% (Precision@15) and 17.2% (Recall@15) over the best baseline."}

We apply the framework to two SLMs, TinyLlama and Llama-2-7B, and benchmark their performance against responses generated by substantially larger models, including Llama-2-70B and GPT-3.5 Turbo. We then employ automatic and human evaluation to assess the responses based on diversity, contextual coherence, as well as overall quality.

To address these limitations, we propose KV-Embedding, a framework that activates the latent representation power of frozen LLMs. Our method leverages the observation that the key-value (KV) states of the final token at each layer encode a compressed view of the sequence. By re-routing these states as a prepended prefix, we enable all tokens to access sequence-level context within a single forward pass. To ensure model-agnostic applicability, we introduce an automated layer selection strategy based on intrinsic dimensionality. Evaluations on MTEB across Qwen, Mistral, and Llama backbones show that KV-Embedding outperforms existing training-free baselines by up to 10%, while maintaining robust performance on sequences up to 4,096 tokens. These results demonstrate that internal state manipulation offers an efficient alternative to input modification, and we hope this work encourages further exploration of LLM internals for representation learning."}

Compared with text transfer between style polarities, UTST for controllable intensity is more challenging due to the subtle differences in stylistic features across different intensity levels. Faced with the challenges posed by the lack of parallel data and the indistinguishability between adjacent intensity levels, we propose a SFT-then-PPO paradigm to fine-tune an LLM. We first fine-tune the LLM with synthesized parallel data. Then, we further train the LLM with PPO, where the rewards are elaborately designed for distinguishing the stylistic intensity in hierarchical levels. Both the global and local stylistic features are considered to formulate the reward functions. The experiments on two UTST benchmarks showcase that both rewards have their advantages and applying them to LLM fine-tuning can effectively improve the performance of an LLM backbone based on various evaluation metrics. Even for close levels of intensity, we can still observe the noticeable stylistic difference between the generated text."}

This paper introduces KS-LIT-3M, a curated corpus of 3.1 million words (16.4 million characters) specifically designed for pretraining language models on Kashmiri. The dataset is structured as a single continuous linear text stream, optimized for causal language model training where models learn to predict subsequent tokens from preceding context. The corpus was constructed through the development of a specialized InPage-to-Unicode converter, followed by rigorous preprocessing including English contamination removal, character normalization, and quality validation.

We incorporate two orthogonal semantic regularizers: a VAD-preserving constraint that aligns generated text with target VAD triples, and a lightweight external appraisal classifier that provides training-time guidance on goal attainment, controllability, certainty, and fairness without injecting long rationales. To improve polarity sensitivity, we introduce Valence Flip augmentation based on mirrored emotional pairs.

Using Qwen-1.8B-Chat as the base model, EmoLoom-2B achieves strong performance on GoEmotions and EmpatheticDialogues, and demonstrates robust cross-corpus generalization on DailyDialog.

We propose Listen, Attend, Understand (LAU), a semantic regularization technique that constrains the acoustic encoder's latent space during training. By leveraging frozen text embeddings to provide a directional auxiliary loss, LAU injects linguistic groundedness into the acoustic representation without increasing inference cost. We evaluate our method on a Bambara-to-French dataset with 30 hours of Bambara speech translated by non-professionals. Experimental results demonstrate that LAU models achieve comparable performance by standard metrics compared to an E2E-ST system pretrained with 100\\% more data and while performing better in preserving semantic meaning. Furthermore, we introduce Total Parameter Drift as a metric to quantify the structural impact of regularization to demonstrate that semantic constraints actively reorganize the encoder's weights to prioritize meaning over literal phonetics. Our findings suggest that LAU is a robust alternative to post-hoc rescoring and a valuable addition to E2E-ST training, especially when training data is scarce and/or noisy."}

Central to the framework is an ELO-based selection mechanism enabling survival-of-the-fittest dynamics while handling non-transitivity in performance. Starting from a naive 70-line baseline, RoboPhD evolves agents through iterative cross-pollination, discovering effective techniques without any external guidance on the Text-to-SQL domain.

Evolution provides the largest gains on cheaper models: while we improve by 2.3 points over a strong Claude Opus 4.5 naive baseline, we show an improvement of 8.9 points over the weaker Claude Haiku model. This enables 'skip a tier' deployment: evolved Haiku exceeds naive Sonnet accuracy, and evolved Sonnet exceeds naive Opus, both at lower cost. The full system achieves 73.67% accuracy on the BIRD test set, demonstrating that AI can autonomously build a strong agentic system with only a trivial human-provided starting point."}

Traditional knowledge representation models often suffer from a gap between static symbolic logic and dynamic system execution. To bridge this divide, KOS-TL leverages Dependent Type Theory to unify data, logic, and proof into a singular computational substrate.The architecture of KOS-TL is organized into three hierarchical layers: the Core Layer, which defines the static type universe and constructive primitives; the Kernel Layer, which governs state evolution through an event-driven mechanism characterized by the triple $\\langle Σ, \\textsf{Ev}, Δ\\rangle$; and the Runtime Layer, responsible for the bidirectional refinement of physical signals into logical evidence. We formally define the operational semantics of the system and prove key meta-theoretical properties, including Progress and Evolutionary Consistency, ensuring that the system remains logically self-consistent and free from stuck states during continuous state transitions.By integrating Davidsonian event semantics with Martin-Löf type theory, KOS-TL enables the construction of \"proof-carrying knowledge,\" where every state change in the knowledge base is accompanied by a formal witness of its validity. We demonstrate the practical utility of this logic through application examples in industrial traceability and cross-border financial compliance. Our results suggest that KOS-TL provides a robust, formally verifiable basis for the next generation of intelligent, autonomous operating systems."}

Existing approaches often train an \"Evil LLM\" to deliberately generate hallucinations on curated datasets, using these induced hallucinations to guide contrastive decoding against a reliable \"positive model\" for hallucination mitigation. However, this strategy is limited by the narrow diversity of hallucinations induced, as Evil LLMs trained on specific error types tend to reproduce only these particular patterns, thereby restricting their overall effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose DHI (Diverse Hallucination Induction), a novel training framework that enables the Evil LLM to generate a broader range of hallucination types without relying on pre-annotated hallucination data. DHI employs a modified loss function that down-weights the generation of specific factually correct tokens, encouraging the Evil LLM to produce diverse hallucinations at targeted positions while maintaining overall factual content. Additionally, we introduce a causal attention masking adaptation to reduce the impact of this penalization on the generation of subsequent tokens. During inference, we apply an adaptive rationality constraint that restricts contrastive decoding to tokens where the positive model exhibits high confidence, thereby avoiding unnecessary penalties on factually correct tokens. Extensive empirical results show that DHI achieves significant performance gains over other contrastive decoding-based approaches across multiple hallucination benchmarks."}

We introduce TTC-aware training, where an intermediate checkpoint and a corresponding TTC configuration can together match or exceed the accuracy of a fully trained model while requiring substantially fewer training FLOPs. Building on this insight, we propose an early stopping algorithm that jointly selects a checkpoint and TTC configuration to minimize training compute without sacrificing accuracy. To make this practical, we develop an efficient TTC evaluation method that avoids exhaustive search, and we formalize a break-even bound that identifies when increased inference compute compensates for reduced training compute. Experiments demonstrate up to 92\\% reductions in training FLOPs while maintaining and sometimes remarkably improving accuracy.

While the former may be mitigated by RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) by anchoring answers in trusted clinical sources, there remains an open question as to whether the most effective model under this paradigm would be one that is fine-tuned on mental health data, or a more general and powerful model that succeeds purely on the basis of reasoning. In this paper, we perform a direct comparison by running four open-source models through the same RAG pipeline using ChromaDB: two generalist reasoners (Qwen2.5-3B and Phi-3-Mini) and two domain-specific fine-tunes (MentalHealthBot-7B and TherapyBot-7B). We use an LLM-as-a-Judge framework to automate evaluation over 50 turns. We find a clear trend: the generalist models outperform the domain-specific ones in empathy (3.72 vs. 3.26, $p < 0.001$) in spite of being much smaller (3B vs. 7B), and all models perform well in terms of safety, but the generalist models show better contextual understanding and are less prone to overfitting as we observe in the domain-specific models. Overall, our results indicate that for RAG-based therapy systems, strong reasoning is more important than training on mental health-specific vocabulary; i.e. a well-reasoned general model would provide more empathetic and balanced support than a larger narrowly fine-tuned model, so long as the answer is already grounded in clinical evidence."}

Our analysis on two multilingual benchmarks, over 29 and 42 languages respectively, reveals that even in low-resource languages, model confidence can increase significantly after instruction-tuning on high-resource language SFT datasets. However, improvements in accuracy are marginal or non-existent, resulting in mis-calibration, highlighting a critical shortcoming of standard SFT for multilingual languages. Furthermore, we observe that the use of label smoothing to be a reasonable method alleviate this concern, again without any need for low-resource SFT data, maintaining better calibration across all languages. Overall, this highlights the importance of multilingual considerations for both training and tuning LLMs in order to improve their reliability and fairness in downstream use."}

To leverage this, we propose Lancet, a novel framework that achieves precise neural intervention by leveraging structural entropy and hallucination difference ratios. Lancet first locates hallucination-prone neurons via gradient-driven contrastive analysis, then maps their propagation pathways by minimizing structural entropy, and finally implements a hierarchical intervention strategy that preserves general model capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations across hallucination benchmark datasets demonstrate that Lancet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of our surgical approach to neural intervention."}

To explore this untapped potential, we propose iFlip, an iterative refinement approach that leverages three types of feedback, including model confidence, feature attribution, and natural language. Our results show that iFlip achieves an average 57.8% higher validity than the five state-of-the-art baselines, as measured by the label flipping rate. The user study further corroborates that iFlip outperforms baselines in completeness, overall satisfaction, and feasibility.

Reliable separation of these sections is important not only for rhetorical role classification but also for downstream tasks such as retrieval and citation analysis. In this work, we introduce a cleaned and sectioned dataset of 251,038 German court decisions derived from the official Open Legal Data dataset. We systematically separated three important sections in German court decisions, namely Tenor (operative part of the decision), Tatbestand (facts of the case), and Entscheidungsgründe (judicial reasoning), which are often inconsistently represented in the original dataset.

We also extracted the Rechtsmittelbelehrung (appeal notice) as a separate field, since it is a procedural instruction and not part of the decision itself. The resulting corpus is publicly available in the JSONL format, making it an accessible resource for further research on the German legal system."}

However, it faced two challenges: simple feature concatenation may not fully exploit complementary information, and the performance gap between LLM-based ASR and end-to-end(E2E) encoder-decoder ASR remained unexplored. In this work, we present an enhanced LLM-based ASR framework that combines fine-tuned Whisper and mHuBERT encoders with an LLM to enrich speech representations. We first evaluate E2E Whisper models with LoRA and full fine-tuning on the MLC-SLM ASR task, and then propose cross-attention-based fusion mechanisms for the parallel-speech-encoder. On the official evaluation set of the MLC-SLM Challenge, our system achieves a CER/WER of 10.69%, ranking on par with the top-ranked Track 1 systems, even though it uses only 1,500 hours of baseline training data compared with their large-scale training sets.

Modern artificial intelligence technologies, including natural language processing and machine-assisted reasoning, hold great promise for addressing this challenge. We present a framework to address the challenge of tools for regulatory application, based on current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for natural language processing (large language models or LLMs) and formalization of legal reasoning (the legal representation system PROLEG). As an example, we focus on Article 6 of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In our framework, a single LLM prompt simultaneously transforms legal text into if-then rules and a corresponding PROLEG encoding, which are then validated and refined by legal domain experts. The final output is an executable PROLEG program that can produce human-readable explanations for instances of GDPR decisions. We describe processes to support the end-to-end transformation of a segment of a regulatory document (Article 6 from GDPR), including the prompting frame to guide an LLM to \"compile\" natural language text to if-then rules, then to further \"compile\" the vetted if-then rules to PROLEG. Finally, we produce an instance that shows the PROLEG execution. We conclude by summarizing the value of this approach and note observed limitations with suggestions to further develop such technologies for capturing and deploying regulatory frameworks."}

We find that task-agnostic features behave largely independently and that only task-dependent features align. These findings challenge common CL intuitions and highlight the need for lightweight, task-dependent difficulty estimators that better reflect model learning behaviour."}

Reasoning capabilities have received attention as a self-verification process to improve output reliability. However, the effect of reasoning within a closed system where LLMs cannot rely on external tools or knowledge has yet to be clarified. We therefore conduct experiments under strict constraints (recommending peer-reviewed journal articles in computer science) to examine the effect of reasoning across multiple models (GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Flash). Our results reveal a problematic trade-off between constraint compliance and factual accuracy. Non-reasoning models exhibit high constraint violation rates (66-75%) but maintain factual accuracy, while reasoning models reduce violations (13-26%) but systematically distort known facts to satisfy constraints and increase complete fabrication. This trade-off pattern is consistent across both models despite different architectures, indicating a fundamental limitation of reasoning. Furthermore, reasoning does not uniformly improve output authenticity: effects diverge by model, reflecting different allocations of the compliance-truthfulness trade-off. These findings challenge the assumption that reasoning universally improves reliability: reasoning models trade honest constraint violations for detection-resistant distortions."}

Firstly, HardGen establishes a dynamic API Graph built upon agent failure cases, from which it samples to synthesize hard traces. Secondly, these traces serve as conditional priors to guide the instantiation of modular, abstract advanced tools, which are subsequently leveraged to formulate hard queries.

EmoHarbor employs a Chain-of-Agent architecture that decomposes users' internal processes into three specialized roles, enabling agents to interact with supporters and complete assessments in a manner similar to human users. We instantiate this benchmark using 100 real-world user profiles that cover a diverse range of personality traits and situations, and define 10 evaluation dimensions of personalized support quality.

In this paper, we introduce a new paradigm for hallucination detection by analyzing the dynamic topology of the evolution of model's layer-wise attention. We model the sequence of attention matrices as a zigzag graph filtration and use zigzag persistence, a tool from Topological Data Analysis, to extract a topological signature. Our core hypothesis is that factual and hallucinated generations exhibit distinct topological signatures. We validate our framework, HalluZig, on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that it outperforms strong baselines. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that these topological signatures are generalizable across different models and hallucination detection is possible only using structural signatures from partial network depth."}

In our experiments, higher capability does not imply lower steerability. We distinguish between authorized steerability (builders reliably reaching intended behaviors) and unauthorized steerability (attackers eliciting disallowed behaviors). This distinction highlights a fundamental safety--security dilemma for open-weight AI models: safety requires high steerability to enforce control (e.g., stop/refuse), while security requires low steerability to prevent malicious actors from eliciting harmful behaviors. This tension is acute for open-weight models, which are currently highly steerable via common techniques such as fine-tuning and adversarial prompting. Using Qwen3 models (4B/30B; Base/Instruct/Thinking) and InstrumentalEval, we find that a short anti-instrumental prompt suffix sharply reduces outputs labeled as instrumental convergence (e.g., shutdown avoidance, deception, self-replication). For Qwen3-30B Instruct, convergence drops from 81.69% under a pro-instrumental suffix to 2.82% under an anti-instrumental suffix.

This work challenges that assumption. We hypothesize that safety- and reasoning-oriented prefix sentences serve as lightweight alignment signals that can guide model decoding toward safer and more coherent responses. To examine this, we fine-tune three R1 series models across three core model capabilities: reasoning (mathematics, coding), safety, and factuality, systematically varying prefix inclusion from 0% to 100%.\n  Results show that prefix-conditioned SFT improves both safety and reasoning performance, yielding up to +6% higher Safe@1 accuracy on adversarial benchmarks (WildJailbreak, StrongReject) and +7% improvement on GSM8K reasoning. However, factuality and coding tasks show marginal or negative effects, indicating that prefix-induced narrowing of the search space benefits structured reasoning. Token-level loss analysis further reveals that prefix tokens such as \"revised\" and \"logically\" incur higher gradient magnitudes, acting as alignment anchors that stabilize reasoning trajectories. Our findings suggest that prefix conditioning offers a scalable and interpretable mechanism for improving reasoning safety, serving as an implicit form of alignment that complements traditional reward-based methods."}

Our benchmark is based on 67 guidelines from the Japan Medical Association and contains over 50,000 adversarial conversations generated using seven automatically discovered jailbreak strategies. Using a dual-LLM scoring protocol, we evaluate 27 models and find that commercial models maintain robust safety while medical-specialized models exhibit increased vulnerability. Furthermore, safety scores decline significantly across conversation turns (median: 9.5 to 5.0, $p < 0.001$). Cross-lingual evaluation on both Japanese and English versions of our benchmark reveals that medical model vulnerabilities persist across languages, indicating inherent alignment limitations rather than language-specific factors.

This paper introduces a novel threat where colluding agents steer victim beliefs using only truthful evidence fragments distributed through public channels, without relying on covert communications, backdoors, or falsified documents. By exploiting LLMs' overthinking tendency, we formalize the first cognitive collusion attack and propose Generative Montage: a Writer-Editor-Director framework that constructs deceptive narratives through adversarial debate and coordinated posting of evidence fragments, causing victims to internalize and propagate fabricated conclusions. To study this risk, we develop CoPHEME, a dataset derived from real-world rumor events, and simulate attacks across diverse LLM families. Our results show pervasive vulnerability across 14 LLM families: attack success rates reach 74.4% for proprietary models and 70.6% for open-weights models. Counterintuitively, stronger reasoning capabilities increase susceptibility, with reasoning-specialized models showing higher attack success than base models or prompts. Furthermore, these false beliefs then cascade to downstream judges, achieving over 60% deception rates, highlighting a socio-technical vulnerability in how LLM-based agents interact with dynamic information environments.

To address this gap, we propose Thinking-KT, a training-free KT framework that incorporates Test-Time Scaling (TTS), enabling even small LLMs to achieve competitive KT performance. Moreover, in this framework, a small LLM can jointly perform KT prediction, personalized feedback generation, and learning recommendation in a unified output without degrading prediction accuracy. Beyond performance, we present the systematic analysis of reasoning traces in KT. Our results demonstrate that TTS is a critical yet underexplored factor in LLM-based KT, and that small LLMs can serve as unified ITS engines."}

To address this issue, we propose a novel residual hierarchical interactive method, HIA for short, that enables bidirectional modeling across granularities. As the core of HIA, the Interactive Attention Module leverages an attention mechanism to achieve dynamic bidirectional interaction, effectively capturing linguistic features at each granularity while integrating correlations between different granularity levels. We also propose a residual hierarchical structure to alleviate the feature forgetting problem when modeling acoustic hierarchies.

It is difficult to answer this question through conversation alone, as genuine introspection cannot be distinguished from confabulations. Here, we address this challenge by injecting representations of known concepts into a model's activations, and measuring the influence of these manipulations on the model's self-reported states. We find that models can, in certain scenarios, notice the presence of injected concepts and accurately identify them. Models demonstrate some ability to recall prior internal representations and distinguish them from raw text inputs. Strikingly, we find that some models can use their ability to recall prior intentions in order to distinguish their own outputs from artificial prefills. In all these experiments, Claude Opus 4 and 4.1, the most capable models we tested, generally demonstrate the greatest introspective awareness; however, trends across models are complex and sensitive to post-training strategies. Finally, we explore whether models can explicitly control their internal representations, finding that models can modulate their activations when instructed or incentivized to \"think about\" a concept. Overall, our results indicate that current language models possess some functional introspective awareness of their own internal states. We stress that in today's models, this capacity is highly unreliable and context-dependent; however, it may continue to develop with further improvements to model capabilities."}

However, there is limited understanding of how these simulated personalities influence critical web search decisions, specifically relevance assessment. Moreover, few studies have examined how simulated personalities impact confidence calibration, specifically the tendencies toward overconfidence or underconfidence. This gap exists even though psychological literature suggests these biases are trait-specific, often linking high extraversion to overconfidence and high neuroticism to underconfidence. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive study evaluating multiple LLMs, including commercial models and open-source models, prompted to simulate Big Five personality traits. We tested these models across three test collections (TREC DL 2019, TREC DL 2020, and LLMJudge), collecting two key outputs for each query-document pair: a relevance judgment and a self-reported confidence score.\n  The findings show that personalities such as low agreeableness consistently align more closely with human labels than the unprompted condition. Additionally, low conscientiousness performs well in balancing the suppression of both overconfidence and underconfidence. We also observe that relevance scores and confidence distributions vary systematically across different personalities. Based on the above findings, we incorporate personality-conditioned scores and confidence as features in a random forest classifier. This approach achieves performance that surpasses the best single-personality condition on a new dataset (TREC DL 2021), even with limited training data. These findings highlight that personality-derived confidence offers a complementary predictive signal, paving the way for more reliable and human-aligned LLM evaluators."}

In this paper, we propose Agentic Memory (AgeMem), a unified framework that integrates LTM and STM management directly into the agent's policy. AgeMem exposes memory operations as tool-based actions, enabling the LLM agent to autonomously decide what and when to store, retrieve, update, summarize, or discard information. To train such unified behaviors, we propose a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning strategy and design a step-wise GRPO to address sparse and discontinuous rewards induced by memory operations.

While various methods have been proposed to filter out such noise, we argue that identifying irrelevant information from retrieved content is inherently difficult and limited number of transformer layers can hardly solve this. Consequently, retrievers fail to filter out irrelevant documents entirely. Therefore, LLMs must be robust against such noise, but we demonstrate that standard fine-tuning approaches are often ineffective in enabling the model to selectively utilize relevant information while ignoring irrelevant content due to the structural constraints of attention patterns. To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning method designed to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information within retrieved documents.

Yet it remains unclear how reliably they extract and infer information at scale. Performance varies with context length and strongly interacts with how information is distributed in real-world corpora. Motivated by these observations, we study how fact placement, corpus-level fact distributions, and Don't Make It Up prompts influence model behavior. We introduce an extended needle-in-a-haystack benchmark across four production-scale models: Gemini-2.5-flash, ChatGPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5-haiku, and Deepseek-v3.2-chat. Unlike prior work, we separately evaluate literal extraction, logical inference, and hallucination risk. Our study considers both positional effects and realistic distributions of evidence across long contexts, as well as prompts that explicitly discourage fabrication. We find that longer contexts alone do not guarantee better performance and can be detrimental when relevant evidence is diluted or widely dispersed. Performance varies substantially across models: some show severe degradation under realistic conditions, while others remain more robust at longer context lengths. Anti-hallucination (AH) instructions can make some models overly conservative, sharply reducing accuracy in literal extraction and logical inference. While we do not directly compare retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and cache-augmented generation (CAG), our results suggest many failures stem from ineffective context utilization. Models often struggle to identify and prioritize relevant information even when it is present. These findings have direct practical implications, as enterprise workflows increasingly involve pasting large volumes of unfiltered documents into LLM prompts. Effective context length and model-specific robustness to long contexts are therefore critical for reliable LLM deployment in research and business."}

This paper presents a cost-efficient, cross-lingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for Bengali agricultural advisory that emphasizes factual grounding and practical deployability. The proposed system adopts a translation-centric architecture in which Bengali user queries are translated into English, enriched through domain-specific keyword injection to align colloquial farmer terminology with scientific nomenclature, and answered via dense vector retrieval over a curated corpus of English agricultural manuals (FAO, IRRI). The generated English response is subsequently translated back into Bengali to ensure accessibility. The system is implemented entirely using open-source models and operates on consumer-grade hardware without reliance on paid APIs. Experimental evaluation demonstrates reliable source-grounded responses, robust rejection of out-of-domain queries, and an average end-to-end latency below 20 seconds.

To improve inference efficiency and KV-cache compatibility, prior work commonly adopts block-based diffusion, decoding tokens block by block. However, this paradigm suffers from a structural limitation that we term Boundary-Induced Context Truncation (BICT): undecoded tokens near block boundaries are forced to commit without access to nearby future context, even when such context could substantially reduce uncertainty. This limitation degrades decoding confidence and generation quality, especially for tasks requiring precise reasoning, such as mathematical problem solving and code generation. We propose Deferred Commitment Decoding (DCD), a novel, training-free decoding strategy that mitigates this issue. DCD maintains a confidence-aware sliding window over masked tokens, resolving low-uncertainty tokens early while deferring high-uncertainty tokens until sufficient contextual evidence becomes available. This design enables effective bidirectional information flow within the decoding window without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion language models, benchmarks, and caching configurations show that DCD improves generation accuracy by 1.39% with comparable time on average compared to fixed block-based diffusion methods, with the most significant improvement reaching 9.0%. These results demonstrate that deferring token commitment based on uncertainty is a simple yet effective principle for improving both the quality and efficiency of diffusion language model decoding."}

Typically, this router is trained once and then frozen, rendering routing decisions brittle under distribution shifts. We address this limitation by introducing kNN-MoE, a retrieval-augmented routing framework that reuses optimal expert assignments from a memory of similar past cases. This memory is constructed offline by directly optimizing token-wise routing logits to maximize the likelihood on a reference set. Crucially, we use the aggregate similarity of retrieved neighbors as a confidence-driven mixing coefficient, thus allowing the method to fall back to the frozen router when no relevant cases are found. Experiments show kNN-MoE outperforms zero-shot baselines and rivals computationally expensive supervised fine-tuning."}

The dynamics of model confidence in multi-turn conversations, where context accumulates and ambiguity is progressively resolved, remain largely unexplored. Reliable confidence estimation in multi-turn settings is critical for many downstream applications, such as autonomous agents and human-in-the-loop systems. This work presents the first systematic study of confidence estimation in multi-turn interactions, establishing a formal evaluation framework grounded in two key desiderata: per-turn calibration and monotonicity of confidence as more information becomes available. To facilitate this, we introduce novel metrics, including a length-normalized Expected Calibration Error (InfoECE), and a new \"Hinter-Guesser\" paradigm for generating controlled evaluation datasets. Our experiments reveal that widely-used confidence techniques struggle with calibration and monotonicity in multi-turn dialogues. We propose P(Sufficient), a logit-based probe that achieves comparatively better performance, although the task remains far from solved. Our work provides a foundational methodology for developing more reliable and trustworthy conversational agents."}

The development of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of medicine and holds promise for improving health care quality and expanding access to medical information globally. However, existing LLMs are primarily trained on high-resource languages, limiting their applicability in global medical scenarios. To address this gap, we constructed GlobMed, a large multilingual medical dataset, containing over 500,000 entries spanning 12 languages, including four low-resource languages. Building on this, we established GlobMed-Bench, which systematically assesses 56 state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs across multiple multilingual medical tasks, revealing significant performance disparities across languages, particularly for low-resource languages. Additionally, we introduced GlobMed-LLMs, a suite of multilingual medical LLMs trained on GlobMed, with parameters ranging from 1.7B to 8B. GlobMed-LLMs achieved an average performance improvement of over 40% relative to baseline models, with a more than threefold increase in performance on low-resource languages. Together, these resources provide an important foundation for advancing the equitable development and application of LLMs globally, enabling broader language communities to benefit from technological advances."}

The corpus comprises Arabic radio speech collected from streaming services across the Arab world. Our data pipeline captures 30-second segments from verified radio streams, encompassing both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and diverse dialectal speech. To ensure reliability, each clip was annotated by one to three native Arabic reviewers who assigned rich metadata, including emotion, speech type, dialect category, and a validity flag for dialect identification tasks. The resulting corpus comprises 6,907 annotations and 3,790 unique audio segments spanning 58 cities across 19 countries. These fine-grained annotations enable robust multi-task learning, serving as a benchmark for city-level dialect tagging.

Prior work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can transform these outputs into natural language explanations (NLEs), but it remains unclear which factors contribute to high-quality explanations. We present a systematic factorial study investigating how Forecasting model choice, XAI method, LLM selection, and prompting strategy affect NLE quality. Our design spans four models (XGBoost (XGB), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and SARIMAX - comparing black-box Machine-Learning (ML) against classical time-series approaches), three XAI conditions (SHAP, LIME, and a no-XAI baseline), three LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama-3-8B, DeepSeek-R1), and eight prompting strategies. Using G-Eval, an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation method, with dual LLM judges and four evaluation criteria, we evaluate 660 explanations for time-series forecasting. Our results suggest that: (1) XAI provides only small improvements over no-XAI baselines, and only for expert audiences; (2) LLM choice dominates all other factors, with DeepSeek-R1 outperforming GPT-4o and Llama-3; (3) we observe an interpretability paradox: in our setting, SARIMAX yielded lower NLE quality than ML models despite higher prediction accuracy; (4) zero-shot prompting is competitive with self-consistency at 7-times lower cost; and (5) chain-of-thought hurts rather than helps."}

Diffusion language models (DLMs) promise parallel generation but suffer from a fundamental static-to-dynamic misalignment: Training optimizes local transitions under fixed schedules, whereas efficient inference requires adaptive \"long-jump\" refinements through unseen states. Our goal is to enable highly parallel decoding for DLMs with low number of function evaluations while preserving generation quality. To achieve this, we propose CD4LM, a framework that decouples training from inference via Discrete-Space Consistency Distillation (DSCD) and Confidence-Adaptive Decoding (CAD). Unlike standard objectives, DSCD trains a student to be trajectory-invariant, mapping diverse noisy states directly to the clean distribution. This intrinsic robustness enables CAD to dynamically allocate compute resources based on token confidence, aggressively skipping steps without the quality collapse typical of heuristic acceleration. On GSM8K, CD4LM matches the LLaDA baseline with a 5.18x wall-clock speedup; across code and math benchmarks, it strictly dominates the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, achieving a 3.62x mean speedup while improving average accuracy.

This raises a significant challenge for implementation, especially for Edge devices. Unlike cloud computing, memory and processing power for Edge devices are very limited, which necessitates developing novel ideas to make such applications feasible. In this work, we investigate compressing weights with a special quantization that limits numbers to only power-of-two (PoT). This helps save a huge amount of memory as only exponents need to be stored, more importantly, it significantly reduces processing power by replacing costly multiplication with low cost bit shifting. To overcome performance loss due to this strict quantization, we investigate Quantization Aware Training (QAT) to enhance performance through additional training. Results on GPT-2 124M show a major enhancement for quantized PoT model after additional training, with a perplexity enhancement of 66% and BERT-Score loss to baseline GPT-2 of 1%. The memory saving is estimated to be 87.5% while the inference speed is expected to be 3-10x faster with PoT quantization versus full-precision."}

While ``pluralistic'' modeling as used in economics and the social sciences aims to capture perspective differences across contexts, current Large Language Model (LLM) prompting techniques have different results across different personas and base models. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of persona-aware toxicity detection, showing that no single prompting method, including our proposed automated prompt optimization strategy, uniformly dominates across all model-persona pairs. To exploit complementary errors, we explore ensembling four prompting variants and propose a lightweight meta-ensemble: an SVM over the 4-bit vector of prompt predictions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SVM ensemble consistently outperforms individual prompting methods and traditional majority-voting techniques, achieving the strongest overall performance across diverse personas. This work provides one of the first systematic comparisons of persona-conditioned prompting for toxicity detection and offers a robust method for pluralistic evaluation in subjective NLP tasks."}
