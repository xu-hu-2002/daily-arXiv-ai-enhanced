This is advantageous as it\nallows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to\nlow-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this\nproblem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained\nand unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model\n$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak\npredictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the\ntwo weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base\nmodel with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted\nmodel learns to exploit for improved performance.

Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model\nreliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.\nTo understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in\nmodel outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis\nrequires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing\noccurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the\nabsence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of\nmetrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of\nmetrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these\nlimitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret\ndataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised\nCompression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret\nrepresentation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to\nidentify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze\nactivation patterns.
