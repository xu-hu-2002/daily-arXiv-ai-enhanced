However, standard approaches to\nsuch modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that\nimpose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that\noccur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic\nmodel of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,\nthat captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in\nspace and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes\nprocess, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new\nfixation occurring near it in time and space.

Materials and\nMethods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,000 consecutive radiology\nreports (250 each: radiography, ultrasonography, CT, MRI) from the MIMIC-III\ndatabase. Two external datasets (CheXpert and Open-i) were validation sets.\nThree LLM frameworks were tested: (1) single-prompt detector; (2) extractor\nplus detector; and (3) extractor, detector, and false-positive verifier.\nPrecision was measured by PPV and absolute true positive rate (aTPR).\nEfficiency was calculated from model inference charges and reviewer\nremuneration.
