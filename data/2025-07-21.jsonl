As conversation\nhistories become longer, existing large language models face increasing\ncomputational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide\nefficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either\ncompress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on\nfixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and\nunpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper,\nwe present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework\nfor large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two\nmain innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the\nprefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the\nattention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value\ncompression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient\ncache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new\nbenchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query\npositions and conversational dependencies.

In this\npaper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific\narticles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct\napproaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient\nparagraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking\nthese questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and\nsubsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content\nof the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires\ncomparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach\nleverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by\nfine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles\nand using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction\nmethod to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as\nthe centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure\nassesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article\ncompared to its prevalence in the literature.

RHYTHM partitions\ntrajectories into daily segments encoded as discrete tokens with hierarchical\nattention, capturing both daily and weekly dependencies while substantially\nreducing the sequence length. Token representations are enriched with\npre-computed prompt embeddings via a frozen LLM, enhancing the model's ability\nto capture interdependencies without extensive computational overhead. By\nfreezing the LLM backbone, RHYTHM achieves significant computational\nefficiency. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates a 2.4%\nimprovement in accuracy, 5.0% increase on weekends, and 24.6% reduction in\ntraining time compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

The CPC,\nbased on expert knowledge judgment, is used to calculate the weights of\nevaluation criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,\nspecificity, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa (Kappa), and\nefficiency. Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), Random\nForest, Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM), and A Lite Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers (ALBERT) are chosen as classification baseline models. A weighted\ndecision matrix consisting of classification evaluation scores with respect to\ncriteria weights, is formed to select the best classification model for a\nclassification problem. Three open datasets of social media are used to\ndemonstrate the feasibility of the proposed CPC-CMS. Based on our simulation,\nfor evaluation results excluding the time factor, ALBERT is the best for the\nthree datasets; if time consumption is included, no single model always\nperforms better than the other models. The CPC-CMS can be applied to the other\nclassification applications in different areas."}

We evaluated a range of closed-source and open-source LLMs on\ntasks such as biomedical text classification and generation, question\nanswering, and multimodal image processing. Our experimental findings indicate\nthat there is no single LLM that can consistently outperform others across all\ntasks. Instead, different LLMs excel in different tasks. While some\nclosed-source LLMs demonstrate strong performance on specific tasks, their\nopen-source counterparts achieve comparable results (sometimes even better),\nwith additional benefits like faster inference and enhanced privacy. Our\nexperimental results offer valuable insights for selecting models that are\noptimally suited for specific biomedical applications."}

The Rational Speech Act\n(RSA) framework offers a principled approach to pragmatic reasoning, but\nexisting extensions face challenges in scaling to multi-turn, collaborative\nscenarios. In this paper, we introduce Collaborative Rational Speech Act\n(CRSA), an information-theoretic (IT) extension of RSA that models multi-turn\ndialog by optimizing a gain function adapted from rate-distortion theory. This\ngain is an extension of the gain model that is maximized in the original RSA\nmodel but takes into account the scenario in which both agents in a\nconversation have private information and produce utterances conditioned on the\ndialog. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRSA on referential games and\ntemplate-based doctor-patient dialogs in the medical domain. Empirical results\nshow that CRSA yields more consistent, interpretable, and collaborative\nbehavior than existing baselines-paving the way for more pragmatic and socially\naware language agents."}

Despite their\nimportance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For\ninstance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III\n(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\\%$ of hospital visits include progress\nnotes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the\ndataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different\naspects of care.\n  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered\nEvidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by\nsimulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress\nnotes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal\nalignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into\nstructured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically\ninformed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant\ncontent from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to\nprompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and\ntemporally aware progress notes.\n  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and\ncomplete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong\nlongitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,\nsurpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative\ncoherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved\ndownstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical\ndecision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in\nreal-world healthcare settings."}

However, their unpredictability,\ncombined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous\nevaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research\nand to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.\n  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts\n(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included\ncomplete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as\nidentifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of\nTask 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.\nSubmissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation\nfrom biomedical experts.\n  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,\nwith models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In\nmanual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of\nfactual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,\nreference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.\nIn Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying\nhow to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems\ndid well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not\nin brevity.\n  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to\nadapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting\ntheir deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools."}
