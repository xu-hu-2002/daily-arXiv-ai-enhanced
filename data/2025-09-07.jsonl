This\npaper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate\nsemantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by\nencoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a\nmonologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived\nfrom text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence\nscores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments.

We present a cheap, scalable\nmethod for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form\ngenerations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach\ntargets \\emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,\ncitations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level\nlabels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology\nthat leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels\nindicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables\nus to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient\nmethods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our\nclassifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including\nmore expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for\nLlama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering\nsettings.

In this paper, we bridge this gap by\ndeveloping a principled topic identification method grounded in the\nDeterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key\ncontribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for\nhigh-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a\ncomputationally efficient upper bound.

Since the COVID-19\npandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies\nto allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been\nmassively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such\nas BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT\n(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this\nstudy, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their\ndifferent characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and\nmetrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some\nresearch gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other\nlanguages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern\ntechniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field."}

We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for\ncomprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline\nfor consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +\nActing) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring\ngrounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce\nhallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary\nknowledge base.

These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from\nnatural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed\ntask prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender\nbias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative\npurpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test\nmodels under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and\n(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity\nacross four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice\nmetrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias\noutcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics\nfurther tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures.
