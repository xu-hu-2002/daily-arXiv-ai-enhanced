However, numerous\nmethodologies frequently neglect the calibration capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs), which capitalize on their robust in-context reasoning prowess.\nThis work illustrates that providing LLMs with specific cues substantially\nimproves their calibration efficacy, especially in multi-round calibrations. We\npresent a new SGIC: Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework that employs\nuncertainty scores as a tool. Initially, this framework calculates uncertainty\nscores to determine both the relevance of each document to the query and the\nconfidence level in the responses produced by the LLMs. Subsequently, it\nreevaluates these scores iteratively, amalgamating them with prior responses to\nrefine calibration. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative approach for\nconstructing an iterative self-calibration training set, which optimizes LLMs\nto efficiently harness uncertainty scores for capturing critical information\nand enhancing response accuracy. Our proposed framework significantly improves\nperformance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs."}

While much of the research has traditionally focused on\nharmful speech in general, the need for generalizable techniques to detect\nveiled and subtle forms of hate has become increasingly pressing. Based on\nlexicon analysis, we hypothesize that implicit hate speech is already present\nin publicly available harmful speech datasets but may not have been explicitly\nrecognized or labeled by annotators. Additionally, crowdsourced datasets are\nprone to mislabeling due to the complexity of the task and often influenced by\nannotators' subjective interpretations. In this paper, we propose an approach\nto address the detection of implicit hate speech and enhance generalizability\nacross diverse datasets by leveraging existing harmful speech datasets. Our\nmethod comprises three key components: influential sample identification,\nreannotation, and augmentation using Llama-3 70B and GPT-4o.

We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether\nan LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing\nconsistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing\nbetween prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation\napproach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three\ncomponents: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model\ninstability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the\nvariability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than\nsuperficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how\nmuch of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model\ninstability or alternative wording.
