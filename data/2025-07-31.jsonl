The emergence of\nVietnamese LLMs (ViLLMs) highlights lightweight open-source models as a\npractical choice for their accuracy, efficiency, and privacy benefits. However,\ndomain-specific evaluations remain limited, and the absence of benchmark\ndatasets reflecting real customer interactions makes it difficult for\nenterprises to select suitable models for support applications. To address this\ngap, we introduce the Customer Support Conversations Dataset (CSConDa), a\ncurated benchmark of over 9,000 QA pairs drawn from real interactions with\nhuman advisors at a large Vietnamese software company. Covering diverse topics\nsuch as pricing, product availability, and technical troubleshooting, CSConDa\nprovides a representative basis for evaluating ViLLMs in practical scenarios.\nWe further present a comprehensive evaluation framework, benchmarking 11\nlightweight open-source ViLLMs on CSConDa with both automatic metrics and\nsyntactic analysis to reveal model strengths, weaknesses, and linguistic\npatterns. This study offers insights into model behavior, explains performance\ndifferences, and identifies key areas for improvement, supporting the\ndevelopment of next-generation ViLLMs. By establishing a robust benchmark and\nsystematic evaluation, our work enables informed model selection for customer\nservice QA and advances research on Vietnamese LLMs. The dataset is publicly\navailable at\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/ura-hcmut/Vietnamese-Customer-Support-QA."}

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce \\textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to\nactively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through\nfine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage\npipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction\ndataset covering both \\textit{direct} and \\textit{reasoning responses}; 2)\nsupervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit\nlength-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward\nsignals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality.
