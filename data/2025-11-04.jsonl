However, their ability to create complex visualiza-\ntions for scaled and structured data remains largely unevaluated and\nunderdevel- oped. To address this gap, we introduce PlotCraft, a new benchmark\nfeaturing 1k challenging visualization tasks that cover a wide range of topics,\nsuch as fi- nance, scientific research, and sociology. The benchmark is\nstructured around seven high-level visualization tasks and encompasses 48\ndistinct chart types. Cru- cially, it is the first to systematically evaluate\nboth single-turn generation and multi-turn refinement across a diverse spectrum\nof task complexities. Our com- prehensive evaluation of 23 leading LLMs on\nPlotCraft reveals obvious per- formance deficiencies in handling sophisticated\nvisualization tasks. To bridge this performance gap, we develope SynthVis-30K,\na large-scale, high-quality dataset of complex visualization code synthesized\nvia a collaborative agent frame- work. Building upon this dataset, we develope\nPlotCraftor, a novel code gener- ation model that achieves strong capabilities\nin complex data visualization with a remarkably small size. Across VisEval,\nPandasPlotBench, and our proposed PlotCraft, PlotCraftor shows performance\ncomparable to that of leading propri- etary approaches.

Answering\nexpert-level questions about 5G specifications requires navigating thousands of\npages of cross-referenced standards that evolve across releases. Existing\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, including telecom-specific\napproaches, rely on semantic similarity and cannot reliably resolve\ncross-references or reason about specification evolution. We present DeepSpecs,\na RAG system enhanced by structural and temporal reasoning via three\nmetadata-rich databases: SpecDB (clause-aligned specification text), ChangeDB\n(line-level version diffs), and TDocDB (standardization meeting documents).\nDeepSpecs explicitly resolves cross-references by recursively retrieving\nreferenced clauses through metadata lookup, and traces specification evolution\nby mining changes and linking them to Change Requests that document design\nrationale. We curate two 5G QA datasets: 573 expert-annotated real-world\nquestions from practitioner forums and educational resources, and 350\nevolution-focused questions derived from approved Change Requests. Across\nmultiple LLM backends, DeepSpecs outperforms base models and state-of-the-art\ntelecom RAG systems; ablations confirm that explicit cross-reference resolution\nand evolution-aware retrieval substantially improve answer quality,\nunderscoring the value of modeling the structural and temporal properties of 5G\nstandards."}

Understanding their\ninteraction is key to assessing the grounding of NLEs, yet it remains\nunderexplored. Prior work has largely examined only single-step generation,\ntypically the final answer, and has modelled PK and CK interaction only as a\nbinary choice in a rank-1 subspace. This overlooks richer forms of interaction,\nsuch as complementary or supportive knowledge. We propose a novel rank-2\nprojection subspace that disentangles PK and CK contributions more accurately\nand use it for the first multi-step analysis of knowledge interactions across\nlonger NLE sequences. Experiments on four QA datasets and three open-weight\ninstruction-tuned LLMs show that diverse knowledge interactions are poorly\nrepresented in a rank-1 subspace but are effectively captured in our rank-2\nformulation. Our multi-step analysis reveals that hallucinated NLEs align\nstrongly with the PK direction, context-faithful ones balance PK and CK, and\nChain-of-Thought prompting for NLEs shifts generated NLEs toward CK by reducing\nPK reliance.

Improvements in memory and context size have\nallowed these models to become more autonomous, which has also resulted in more\ntext accumulation in their context windows without explicit user intervention.\nThis comes with a latent risk: the belief profiles of models -- their\nunderstanding of the world as manifested in their responses or actions -- may\nsilently change as context accumulates. This can lead to subtly inconsistent\nuser experiences, or shifts in behavior that deviate from the original\nalignment of the models. In this paper, we explore how accumulating context by\nengaging in interactions and processing text -- talking and reading -- can\nchange the beliefs of language models, as manifested in their responses and\nbehaviors.Our results reveal that models' belief profiles are highly malleable:\nGPT-5 exhibits a 54.7% shift in its stated beliefs after 10 rounds of\ndiscussion about moral dilemmas and queries about safety, while Grok 4 shows a\n27.2% shift on political issues after reading texts from the opposing position.\nWe also examine models' behavioral changes by designing tasks that require tool\nuse, where each tool selection corresponds to an implicit belief. We find that\nthese changes align with stated belief shifts, suggesting that belief shifts\nwill be reflected in actual behavior in agentic systems. Our analysis exposes\nthe hidden risk of belief shift as models undergo extended sessions of talking\nor reading, rendering their opinions and actions unreliable."}

Current approaches to length control, including Regularized DPO,\nLength-Instruction Fine Tuning, and tool-augmented methods, typically require\nexpensive model retraining or complex inference-time tooling. This paper\npresents a prompt engineering methodology that enables precise length control\nwithout model retraining. Our structure-guided approach implements deliberate\nplanning and word counting mechanisms within the prompt, encouraging the model\nto carefully track and adhere to specified length constraints. Comprehensive\nevaluations across six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly improves length fidelity for several models compared to standard\nprompting when applied to document summarization tasks, particularly for\nshorter-to-medium length constraints. The proposed technique shows varying\nbenefits across different model architectures, with some models demonstrating\nup to 37.6% improvement in length adherence.
