The discourse on methodological rigour in this new genre of research\nis still emerging. Against this backdrop, I attempt to offer guidance on\nmethodological rigour, particularly in the context of topic modelling\nalgorithms. By illustrating the application of the structural topic modelling\nalgorithm and presenting a set of guidelines, I discuss how to ensure rigour in\ntopic modelling studies. Although the guidelines are for the application of\ntopic modelling algorithms, they can be applied to other algorithms with\ncontext-specific adjustments. The guidelines are helpful, especially for novice\nresearchers applying topic modelling, and editors and reviewers handling topic\nmodelling manuscripts. I contribute to the literature on topic modelling and\njoin the emerging dialogue on methodological rigour in computationally\nintensive theory construction research."}

As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to\nunderstand how LLMs function collectively during collaboration, compared to\nindividual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a\nutilitarian boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that maximize benefits\nfor the greatest number of people despite harms. We study whether a similar\ndynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on\nwell-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where\nmodels reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn\ndiscussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must\ndecide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all\nmodels found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than\nindividually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that\nmaximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar\nindividuals. Others became more willing to violate moral norms in groups.\nHowever, while human groups show a similar action bias, the mechanism for their\nutilitarian boost differs from LLMs. Whereas the human shift comes from\nheightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups show either reduced\nnorm sensitivity or enhanced impartiality. This suggests that while the surface\nbehavior of LLM collectives mimics human group reasoning, the underlying\ndrivers differ. We discuss the implications for AI alignment, multi-agent\ndesign, and artificial moral reasoning."}

To\nencourage community-driven development of leaderboards in other languages, we\nexplain our methodology, including guidance on selecting the most suitable\nevaluation setup for each downstream task. In particular, we provide a\nrationale for using fewer few-shot examples than typically found in the\nliterature, aiming to reduce environmental impact and facilitate access to\nreproducible results for a broader research community."}

Unlike traditional benchmarks\nfor scientific literature understanding and synthesis, SciArena engages the\nresearch community directly, following the Chatbot Arena evaluation approach of\ncommunity voting on model comparisons. By leveraging collective intelligence,\nSciArena offers a community-driven evaluation of model performance on\nopen-ended scientific tasks that demand literature-grounded, long-form\nresponses. The platform currently supports 23 open-source and proprietary\nfoundation models and has collected over 13,000 votes from trusted researchers\nacross diverse scientific domains. We analyze the data collected so far and\nconfirm that the submitted questions are diverse, aligned with real-world\nliterature needs, and that participating researchers demonstrate strong\nself-consistency and inter-annotator agreement in their evaluations. We discuss\nthe results and insights based on the model ranking leaderboard. To further\npromote research in building model-based automated evaluation systems for\nliterature tasks, we release SciArena-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark based\non our collected preference data. The benchmark measures the accuracy of models\nin judging answer quality by comparing their pairwise assessments with human\nvotes. Our experiments highlight the benchmark's challenges and emphasize the\nneed for more reliable automated evaluation methods."}
