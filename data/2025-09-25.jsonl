Given query-specific context significantly improves the\nusefulness of its responses. In this paper, we present a specification that can\nbe used to dynamically build context for data sources. The data source owner\ncreates the file containing metadata for LLMs to use when reasoning about\ndataset-related queries. To demonstrate our proposed specification, we created\na prototype Readme_AI Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that retrieves the\nmetadata from the data source and uses it to dynamically build context. Some\nfeatures that make this specification dynamic are the extensible types that\nrepresent crawling web-pages, fetching data from data repositories, downloading\nand parsing publications, and general text. The context is formatted and\ngrouped using user-specified tags that provide clear contextual information for\nthe LLM to reason about the content. We demonstrate the capabilities of this\nearly prototype by asking the LLM about the NIST-developed Hedgehog library,\nfor which common LLMs often provides inaccurate and irrelevant responses\ncontaining hallucinations. With Readme_AI, the LLM receives enough context that\nit is now able to reason about the library and its use, and even generate code\ninterpolated from examples that were included in the Readme_AI file provided by\nHedgehog's developer.

Extending\nOff-Policy Evaluation (OPE) to pluralistic preference alignment, therefore,\nremains an open question.

In the context of\npersonalization, we define a model as robust if its responses are both\nfactually accurate and align with the user preferences. To assess this, we\nintroduce PERG, a scalable framework for evaluating robustness in LLMs, along\nwith a new dataset, PERGData. We evaluate fourteen models from five different\nmodel families using different prompting methods. Our findings show that\ncurrent LLMs struggle with robust personalization: even the strongest models\n(GPT-4.1, LLaMA3-70B) fail to maintain correctness in 5% of previously\nsuccessful cases without personalization, while smaller models (e.g., 7B-scale)\ncan fail more than 20% of the time.

We introduce DRES (Disfluency Removal Evaluation Suite), a controlled\ntext-level benchmark that establishes a reproducible semantic upper bound for\nthis task. DRES builds on human-annotated Switchboard transcripts, isolating\ndisfluency removal from ASR errors and acoustic variability. We systematically\nevaluate proprietary and open-source LLMs across scales, prompting strategies,\nand architectures. Our results reveal that (i) simple segmentation consistently\nimproves performance, even for long-context models; (ii) reasoning-oriented\nmodels tend to over-delete fluent tokens; and (iii) fine-tuning achieves near\nstate-of-the-art precision and recall but harms generalization abilities. We\nfurther present a set of LLM-specific error modes and offer nine practical\nrecommendations (R1-R9) for deploying disfluency removal in speech-driven\npipelines. DRES provides a reproducible, model-agnostic foundation for\nadvancing robust spoken-language systems."}

It\nserves as the script for numerous languages, including Tigrinya and Amharic,\nand played a pivotal role in Ethiopia's cultural and religious development\nduring the Aksumite kingdom era. Ge'ez remains significant as a liturgical\nlanguage in Ethiopia and Eritrea, with much of the national identity\ndocumentation recorded in Ge'ez. These written materials are invaluable primary\nsources for studying Ethiopian and Eritrean philosophy, creativity, knowledge,\nand civilization. Ge'ez has a complex morphological structure with rich\ninflectional and derivational morphology, and no usable NLP has been developed\nand published until now due to the scarcity of annotated linguistic data,\ncorpora, labeled datasets, and lexicons. Therefore, we propose a rule-based\nGe'ez morphological synthesizer to generate surface words from root words\naccording to the morphological structures of the language. We used 1,102 sample\nverbs, representing all verb morphological structures, to test and evaluate the\nsystem. The system achieves a performance of 97.4%, outperforming the baseline\nmodel and suggesting that future work should build a comprehensive system\nconsidering morphological variations of the language.\n  Keywords: Ge'ez, NLP, morphology, morphological synthesizer, rule-based"}

Our innovative training recipe\nstrategically captures knowledge from larger models via encoder-decoder\ninitialization and geometric embedding distillation. We improve model\nrobustness and expressiveness with a spread-out regularizer, and ensure\ngeneralizability by merging checkpoints from varied, optimized mixtures.\nEvaluated on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across multilingual,\nEnglish, and code domains, EmbeddingGemma (300M) achieves state-of-the-art\nresults. Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open,\nwith fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models\ndouble its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably,\nthis lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embedding\noutputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency and\nhigh-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablation\nstudies exploring our key design choices. We release EmbeddingGemma to the\ncommunity to promote further research."}

However, RLVR leads to limited generalization for open-ended tasks --\nsuch as writing outline essays or making meal plans -- where humans reason\nroutinely. This paper shows that the RLVR paradigm is effective beyond\nverifiable domains, and introduces **RL** with **M**odel-rewarded **T**hinking\n(**RLMT**) for general-purpose chat capabilities. Using diverse real-world\nprompts, RLMT requires LMs to generate long CoT reasoning before response, and\noptimizes them with online RL against a preference-based reward model used in\nRLHF. Across 40 training runs on Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B (both base and\ninstruct) and multiple optimization algorithms (DPO, PPO, and GRPO), RLMT\nconsistently outperforms standard RLHF pipelines. This includes substantial\ngains of 3-7 points on three chat benchmarks (AlpacaEval2, WildBench, and\nArenaHardV2), along with 1-3 point improvements on other tasks like creative\nwriting and general knowledge. Our best 8B model surpasses GPT-4o in chat and\ncreative writing and rivals Claude-3.7-Sonnet (Thinking). RLMT can also be\napplied directly to base models without an SFT stage, akin to R1-Zero training.\nRemarkably, with only 7K prompts, Llama-3.1-8B base trained with our RLMT\nrecipe outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct post-trained with a complex\nmulti-staged pipeline with 25M+ examples. We close with qualitative and\nquantitative analyses of how trained models plan their responses. Our results\nrethink the post-training pipeline and call upon future work to understand and\nemploy thinking more broadly."}
