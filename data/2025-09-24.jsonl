Unlike prior\nmethods such as SPoT, which depends on fixed prompt templates, our study\nintroduces a unified multi-task learning framework with dynamic prompt\nscheduling mechanism. By introducing a prompt pool and a task-aware scheduling\nstrategy, the method dynamically combines and aligns prompts for different\ntasks. This enhances the model's ability to capture semantic differences across\ntasks. During prompt fusion, the model uses task embeddings and a gating\nmechanism to finely control the prompt signals. This ensures alignment between\nprompt content and task-specific demands. At the same time, it builds flexible\nsharing pathways across tasks. In addition, the proposed optimization objective\ncenters on joint multi-task learning. It incorporates an automatic learning\nstrategy for scheduling weights, which effectively mitigates task interference\nand negative transfer. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, a series of\nsensitivity experiments were conducted. These experiments examined the impact\nof prompt temperature parameters and task number variation. The results confirm\nthe advantages of the proposed mechanism in maintaining model stability and\nenhancing transferability. Experimental findings show that the prompt\nscheduling method significantly improves performance on a range of language\nunderstanding and knowledge reasoning tasks. These results fully demonstrate\nits applicability and effectiveness in unified multi-task modeling and\ncross-domain adaptation."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose LAWCAT\n(Linear Attention with Convolution Across Time), a novel linearization\nframework designed to efficiently transfer the capabilities of pre-trained\ntransformers into a performant linear attention architecture. LAWCAT integrates\ncausal Conv1D layers to enhance local dependency modeling and employs\nnormalized gated linear attention to improve generalization across varying\ncontext lengths. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that, distilling\nMistral-7B with only 1K-length sequences yields over 90\\% passkey retrieval\naccuracy up to 22K tokens, significantly extending its effective context\nwindow. Similarly, Llama3.2-1B LAWCAT variant achieves competitive performance\non S-NIAH 1\\&2\\&3 tasks (1K-8K context length) and BABILong benchmark\n(QA2\\&QA3, 0K-16K context length), requiring less than 0.1\\% pre-training\ntokens compared with pre-training models. Furthermore, LAWCAT exhibits faster\nprefill speeds than FlashAttention-2 for sequences exceeding 8K tokens. LAWCAT\nthus provides an efficient pathway to high-performance, long-context linear\nmodels suitable for edge deployment, reducing reliance on extensive\nlong-sequence training data and computational resources."}

In this work, we conduct a large-scale, controlled\nevaluation across several key axes of variability to systematically assess the\nstrengths and weaknesses of LLM-based graph reasoning methods in text-based\napplications. The axes include the LLM-graph interaction mode, comparing\nprompting, tool-use, and code generation; dataset domains, spanning citation,\nweb-link, e-commerce, and social networks; structural regimes contrasting\nhomophilic and heterophilic graphs; feature characteristics involving both\nshort- and long-text node attributes; and model configurations with varying LLM\nsizes and reasoning capabilities. We further analyze dependencies by\nmethodically truncating features, deleting edges, and removing labels to\nquantify reliance on input types. Our findings provide practical and actionable\nguidance. (1) LLMs as code generators achieve the strongest overall performance\non graph data, with especially large gains on long-text or high-degree graphs\nwhere prompting quickly exceeds the token budget.

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data\n(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast\nto prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,\nRLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to\nlearn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement\nlearning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)\nrely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this\ndependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.\nSpecifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the\npolicy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the\npreceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training\ndata, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader\ncontexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive\nexperiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across\nmultiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied\nto Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,\n$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and\nAIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling\nbehavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In\naddition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries\nof LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance."}

Such\nrepresentations are widely used in cognitive science and have the potential to\nserve as a cornerstone for explainable AI. Unfortunately, they have proven\nnotoriously difficult to learn, although recent LLMs appear to capture the\nrequired perceptual features to a remarkable extent. Nonetheless, practical\nmethods for extracting the corresponding conceptual spaces are currently still\nlacking. While various methods exist for extracting embeddings from LLMs,\nextracting conceptual spaces also requires us to encode the underlying\nfeatures. In this paper, we propose a strategy in which features (e.g.\nsweetness) are encoded by embedding the description of a corresponding\nprototype (e.g. a very sweet food). To improve this strategy, we fine-tune the\nLLM to align the prototype embeddings with the corresponding conceptual space\ndimensions. Our empirical analysis finds this approach to be highly effective."}

To address this, we introduce\nSloPalSpeech, a new, large-scale Slovak ASR dataset containing 2,806 hours of\nspeech from parliamentary proceedings. We developed a robust processing\npipeline to align and segment long-form recordings into clean, 30-second\naudio-transcript pairs suitable for model training. We use this dataset to\nfine-tune several OpenAI Whisper models (small, medium, large-v3, and\nlarge-v3-turbo), achieving significant Word Error Rate (WER) reductions on\nstandard Slovak benchmarks like Common Voice and FLEURS. For instance, the\nfine-tuned Whisper-small model's WER dropped by up to 70\\%, approaching the\nbaseline performance of the much larger Whisper-large-v3 model. To foster\nfuture research in low-resource speech recognition, we publicly release the\ncomplete SloPalSpeech dataset, the fully segmented transcripts (60 million\nwords), and all our fine-tuned models."}
