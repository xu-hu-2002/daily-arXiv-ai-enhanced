Prior work has\nexplored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can\nimprove downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such\napproaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the\nmodel used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a\nnovel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning\nability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping\nenvironments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation\ntask into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided\nby distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal\nmodel signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a\nself-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward\nstructure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable\nfine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action\ntypes and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and\nvalues), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental\nresults show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%\ncompared to the baseline."}

We assessed performance across key\ndimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,\npotential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro\nconsistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of\nthe top three models were proprietary.

We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,\nGoogle Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating\nsynthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant\narticles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given\nto the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main\npurpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,\ncorpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer\narchitectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,\nespecially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of\nevaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where\nutility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic\nmedical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a\nmoderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream\nNLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the\nreal documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming\nsparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind\ngenerating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to\ncheck for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in\ngenerating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of\nworkflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of\ndata transfer."}

GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module\nguided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key\nfeature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across\ndiverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing\nLLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving\ncompetitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.\nOur method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution\nfor structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs."}

Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at\ncapturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including\nuneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence\ncontext. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens\nwith optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This\nhybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the\nmodel to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences\nsimultaneously.
