Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of\ntheir own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations.\nThese approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during\ninference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning\n(CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized\noptimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into\nmodel's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining\nfrom answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training\nonly a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by\n30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more\ncompute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines\nsuch as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce\ndomains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution\n(OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in\nboth text-only and vision-language models.

However, many deployments still rely on AR\ndrafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains.

We study the learning dynamics of small models trained on synthetic\nlanguages generated from PCFGs, enabling precise control over grammar\ncomplexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure.

In this work, we focus on UQ\nfor the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to\nquantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic,\ntoken-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the\npredictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution.\nBy decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate\nthe true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model.

We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA\ntask and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance\n(using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context\ncomprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty\n(avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we\nextract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and\nensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score.

However, as reasoning chains extend, critical\nintermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context,\nreceiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we\npropose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of\nreasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories\ninto structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the\nmost relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout\ngeneration. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting\nmethods across six benchmarks. Notably, Self-Anchor significantly reduces the\nperformance gap between ``non-reasoning'' models and specialized reasoning\nmodels, with the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning\ntasks without retraining."}

Reward models assess\nthe quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is\nalso performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI\nmodel. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to\nredundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include\nsusceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking,\nmethods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our\nposition paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help\novercome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward\nmodels on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas.\nGrounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer\nalignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference\nelicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and\ncalibration-aware meta-evaluation."}
