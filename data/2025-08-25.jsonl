This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts\n(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori\nreasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the\nlogical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This\nreflects a significant gap.

The goal\nof prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high\ngeneration quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,\nface challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like\nmissing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token\nremoval. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.\n  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt\ncompression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method\ncenters at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method\nsplits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be\nmore concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We\ndesign several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized\nsemantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,\ncompression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques\neffectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and\ncoherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the\ncompression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and\nsummarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain.

On the basis of a field study and three online\nexperiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has\na detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such\nexchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a\nbrand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as\nface-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a\ndirective way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a\nconversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the\nconversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect\nmore freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,\ndirective language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,\nthe strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect.

Project page:\n  https://github.com/xzf-thu/Mini-Omni-Reasoner", "summary": "Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While\nrecent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit\nreasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in\nLSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the\n\"Thinking-before-Speaking\" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,\nthis sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are\ndelayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and\ncommunication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a\nframework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel\n\"Thinking-in-Speaking\" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before\nproducing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning\ntokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows\ncontinuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,\nleveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although\ninterleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response\ntoken is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we\nintroduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for\ninterleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens\nconsistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient\nlearning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker\narchitecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken\nresponses, maintaining both naturalness and precision.

The core of this review\nexamines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on\nthe formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of\nknowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like\nin-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase\ntransitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive\nand linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for\nunderstanding LLM learning.

Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger\nmodels display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii)\nsusceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models\nrespond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming;\nand (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and\npredictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size.

This work examines whether a language model can also be\nlinked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional\nregister analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from\ndifferent registers.

However, the lack of QA datasets in\nspecific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able\nto generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce\nRoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a\ncomprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We\nconstruct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs\nrelated to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of\n1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered\ncorrectly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process\ncarried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who\nspent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment\nwith four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is\nemployed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one\nbased on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models\nsignificantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that\npretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the\nimportance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for\nreliable clinical QA in Romanian.

Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,\nincluding tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and\nquestion answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We\nevaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model\nfamilies and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric\ninstruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or\ngeneral-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for\nthe language.

However, the mechanisms underlying how and\nwhy accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill\nthis gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy\nchange and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round\nself-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the\naccuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp\n- \\alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$\nrepresents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\\alpha$ determines the\nrate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated\nand the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single\nround of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and\ndatasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with\nempirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work\nprovides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus\npaving the way for further explorations."}
