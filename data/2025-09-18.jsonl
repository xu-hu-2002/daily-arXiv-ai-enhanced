We trained and evaluated two types of models: baseline support vector\nmachines (SVM) and BlueBERT which is a large language model pretrained on\nPubMed abstracts and hospitalized patient data. We assessed for\ngeneralizability of our model in two ways. First, we evaluated models trained\nusing Inst.-train on SF-test. Second, we trained a BlueBERT_TRANSFER model that\nwas first fine-tuned on Inst.-train then on SF-train before testing on SF-test\nset. To further analyze model performance, we also examined a subset of 59\nreports from our Inst. dataset, which were manually edited for clarity.\n  RESULTS Classification performance on the Inst. test achieved AUROC 0.82\nusing SVM and 0.81 using BlueBERT. Without cross-institution transfer learning,\nperformance on the SF test was limited to an AUROC of 0.42 using SVM and 0.56\nusing BlueBERT.

Judging and Explaining Social Biases with LLMs", "comment": "38 pages, 31 figures", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can lead to undesired consequences when\nmisaligned with human values, especially in scenarios involving complex and\nsensitive social biases. Previous studies have revealed the misalignment of\nLLMs with human values using expert-designed or agent-based emulated bias\nscenarios. However, it remains unclear whether the alignment of LLMs with human\nvalues differs across different types of scenarios (e.g., scenarios containing\nnegative vs. non-negative questions). In this study, we investigate the\nalignment of LLMs with human values regarding social biases (HVSB) in different\ntypes of bias scenarios. Through extensive analysis of 12 LLMs from four model\nfamilies and four datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs with large model parameter\nscales do not necessarily have lower misalignment rate and attack success rate.\nMoreover, LLMs show a certain degree of alignment preference for specific types\nof scenarios and the LLMs from the same model family tend to have higher\njudgment consistency. In addition, we study the understanding capacity of LLMs\nwith their explanations of HVSB. We find no significant differences in the\nunderstanding of HVSB across LLMs. We also find LLMs prefer their own generated\nexplanations. Additionally, we endow smaller language models (LMs) with the\nability to explain HVSB. The generation results show that the explanations\ngenerated by the fine-tuned smaller LMs are more readable, but have a\nrelatively lower model agreeability."}

Moreover, discussions of national law about immigration have been\nreplaced over time by international law and human rights, revealing nuances in\ndiscourse trends. Taken together broadly, our findings demonstrate how LLMs can\nsupport scalable, fine-grained discourse analysis in political and historical\ncontexts."}

Unlike many prior models that\nrelease weights without reproducible data pipelines or regard for content-owner\nrights, Apertus models are pretrained exclusively on openly available data,\nretroactively respecting robots.txt exclusions and filtering for\nnon-permissive, toxic, and personally identifiable content. To mitigate risks\nof memorization, we adopt the Goldfish objective during pretraining, strongly\nsuppressing verbatim recall of data while retaining downstream task\nperformance. The Apertus models also expand multilingual coverage, training on\n15T tokens from over 1800 languages, with ~40% of pretraining data allocated to\nnon-English content. Released at 8B and 70B scales, Apertus approaches\nstate-of-the-art results among fully open models on multilingual benchmarks,\nrivalling or surpassing open-weight counterparts. Beyond model weights, we\nrelease all scientific artifacts from our development cycle with a permissive\nlicense, including data preparation scripts, checkpoints, evaluation suites,\nand training code, enabling transparent audit and extension."}
