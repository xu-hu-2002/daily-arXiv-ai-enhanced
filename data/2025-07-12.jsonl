However, it remains unclear if these differences in\nbiases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training\nstochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to\ndisentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using\ndifferent random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$\ncognitive biases. Second, we introduce \\emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping\ninstruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses\ndatasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases\nare dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness\nintroduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models\nwith the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those\nsharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases\nin finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond\nfinetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop\nprincipled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs."}

Despite experimenting with advanced prompt\nengineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection\nstrategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot\nprompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the\nCheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic\nand Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual\ntracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,\nlikely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies.

However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by\ncoreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that\ndisrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how\nentity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance\nin RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual\nunderstanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference\nresolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering\n(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies\nin retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context\ncapturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we\ndiscover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,\nlikely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential\nambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper\nunderstanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,\nproviding guidance for improving retrieval and generation in\nknowledge-intensive AI applications."}

Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to\nembrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful\nin real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured\nmemory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and\nKnowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls\nand coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,\nreason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We\nvalidate MIRIX in two demanding settings.

Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines\nan implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.\nHowever, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,\ncompared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head\nover the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a\ngeneralization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They\ncan be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and\ndiffer only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding\nof the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate\nthe root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,\nis that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,\nthey often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,\nas well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against\nalternative hypotheses for the generalization gap.
