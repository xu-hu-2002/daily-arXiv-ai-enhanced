Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks\non Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing\nnarrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require\nretrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG\npipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs\n-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval\neffectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis\nproves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning\nmodels significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step."}

We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of\npost-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages\nusing five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that\nwhile 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource\nlanguages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and\ntypologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare\nfour quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing\nthat algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF\nvariants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.\nAdditionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding\nhyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched\ncalibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer\nactionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation\nunder quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings."}

However, the\neffectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In\nparticular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing\nICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to\nsuboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong\nbalance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we\nfine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it\nto select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally\naligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies\nsyntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This\nplug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning\nthree semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently\noutperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time\nmodels."}

Existing backdoor defenses either\nlack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only\nmechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like\nmodel-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we\npresent LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through\nknowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,\nLETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then\nmerged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting\nthe backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE\nincorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to\ndistract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on\nclassification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate\nthat LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor\nattacks.
