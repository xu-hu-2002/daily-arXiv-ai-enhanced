While recent investigations establish that specific hidden layers exhibit\ndifferences between hallucinatory and factual content, the precise localization\nof hallucination signals within layers remains unclear, limiting the\ndevelopment of efficient detection methods.

Through\nsystematic experiments across HaluEval's question answering, dialogue, and\nsummarization datasets, we demonstrate that hallucination signals concentrate\nin highly sparse feature subsets, achieving significant accuracy improvements\non question answering and dialogue tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals a\nhierarchical \"funnel pattern\" where shallow layers exhibit high feature\ndiversity while deep layers demonstrate concentrated usage, enabling detection\nperformance to be maintained with minimal degradation using only 1\\% of feature\ndimensions.

We attribute\nthis limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available\ninformation (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality\nassessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize\ncontext quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and\nintroduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric\nquantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when\nremoving each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware\nrelevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI\nvalue eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining\ncontexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label\ndependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate\nmodel for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a\nhierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and\nglobal inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision\nand end-to-end generator feedback.

To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid\nstorage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that\nnot all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial\nfirst and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors\nfor attention.

To bridge this gap, this survey presents a comprehensive\nreview of XAI techniques with a particular emphasis on LMs, organizing them\naccording to their underlying transformer architectures: encoder-only,\ndecoder-only, and encoder-decoder, and analyzing how methods are adapted to\neach while assessing their respective strengths and limitations.

However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While\ngraph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,\nthey face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge\ngraphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted\ngraphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM\nextractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper\npresents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces\nMulti-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these\nlimitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of\na Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly\nincorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving\nSub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical\nlimitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static\ngraph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A\nmulti-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser\nagents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,\nanswer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and\nsubgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively\nbuild a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent\ndrawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise\nreasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning\nbenchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of\nMACER framework."}

We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that\ndetects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals:\nexternal context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while\ninternal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens\nevolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for\nstatistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG\nhallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves\nconsistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based\nmethods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under\nrelaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both\neffectiveness and practicality."}

Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of\ntransformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A\ncauses B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive\nrelations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,\nknowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then\nthere is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can\nlearn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input\nprompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from\ntraining examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this\nstudy, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train\ntransformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer\ntransitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that\ntransformers are capable of learning connectivity on \"grid-like'' directed\ngraphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and\nconnectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that\nthe dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of\ntransformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional\ngrid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In\naddition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly\nbetter generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs.

However, this paradigm is ill-suited for navigating social\nsituations, which induce an interpretive process of analyzing ambiguous cues\nthat rarely yield a definitive outcome. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nCognitive Reasoning, a paradigm modeled on human social cognition. It\nformulates the interpretive process into a structured cognitive flow of\ninterconnected cognitive units (e.g., observation or attribution), which\ncombine adaptively to enable effective social thinking and responses. We then\npropose CogFlow, a complete framework that instills this capability in LLMs.\nCogFlow first curates a dataset of cognitive flows by simulating the\nassociative and progressive nature of human thought via tree-structured\nplanning. After instilling the basic cognitive reasoning capability via\nsupervised fine-tuning, CogFlow adopts reinforcement learning to enable the\nmodel to improve itself via trial and error, guided by a multi-objective reward\nthat optimizes both cognitive flow and response quality.

We investigate the\nrelationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542\nexpert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality\nvia close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram\nnovelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of\ntop-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative,\ncautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike\nhuman-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with\nlower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source\nmodels, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative\nexpressions than humans.
