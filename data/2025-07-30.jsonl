However, they often face challenges in\nacquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training\nparadigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement\nlearning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These\napproaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,\nlimiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing\ninspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the\npotential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.\n  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI\nlearner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI\nteacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a\ncore mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend\nsolely on internal inference or pattern recognition.\n  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the\nAI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results\nindicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving\nmixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with\nlearner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to\nacquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional\ninstructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats\ntypically present in training datasets.\n  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological\ninsights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training\nknowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a\ncomplementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering"}

While existing evaluation\nmethods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general\napproach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology\ncontent degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these\neffects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce\nMNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight\nframework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME\ncompares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The\nPile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral\nshifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,\nemergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent\naccuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and\nrequiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on\nhigh-activation samples can partially reverse these effects. Our results\ndemonstrate that sparse probing and diffing offer a scalable and automated lens\ninto fine-tuning-induced model changes, providing practical tools for\nunderstanding and managing LLM behavior."}

This paper proposes Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a\ngeneralization of the CD framework that employs an ensemble of amateur models\nto more comprehensively characterize undesirable generation patterns. MACD\nintegrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus\npenalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate\neffectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables\ncontrollable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or\ncontent biases.

Although activation-based attribution methods effectively explain\ntransformer-based text classification models, our findings reveal that these\nmethods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations,\nleading to less reliable interpretations. To address this limitation, we\npropose Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that\nrefines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features. By\ncontrasting the activations of an input sequence with reference activations,\nContrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. Experimental\nresults across various datasets and models confirm that Contrast-CAT\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also\nleads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were\nconsistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This\nsuggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance\nand are outperformed by simply using more reports.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nhas emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in\nexternal sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over\nboth the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow\nreasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that\nincorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve\ndecomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes\neach to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information\nthrough a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity,\ntransparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system\ndesign. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources\ndemonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability\nover conventional RAG approaches."}
