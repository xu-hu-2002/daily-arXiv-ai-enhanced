Story identification aims to assign each news article to a\nspecific story that the article is covering.

The fused representations are mapped into the LLM's\nembedding space, enabling it to process multilingual inputs. The model is\ntrained only on English data, without using any parallel or multilingual data.\nEvaluated on XNLI, IndicXNLI, Sinhala News Classification, and Amazon Reviews,\nour Transformer Softmax model significantly outperforms the LangBridge\nbaseline. We observe strong performance gains in LRLs, improving Sinhala\nclassification accuracy from 71.66% to 75.86% and achieving clear improvements\nacross Indic languages such as Tamil, Bengali, and Malayalam. These specific\ngains contribute to an overall boost in average XNLI accuracy from 70.36% to\n71.50%.

A key challenge in this\ndomain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related\nrecords, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and\nthe corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation\nhinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this\nproblem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly\nstudied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document\ncoreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference\n(NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal\ninference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into\nan RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while\naccommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain\nunstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed\nthe best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and\n27% (11.21 points), respectively. Our work demonstrates how domain adaptation\nof the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can\nbe effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and\nconnectivity in shift logs."}

While\nnumerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation\nabilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they\noften rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to\nscale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,\nmost existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual\nbenchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To\naddress these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for\ngenerating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual\nannotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases\nby generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a\nmultilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order\nproblem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we\nintroduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising\n3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is\nspecifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical\nmultilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary\nLLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The\nresults show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,\ndiversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce\nAutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their\nfew-shot code generation capabilities. We hope the AutoCodeBench series will\nserve as a valuable resource and inspire the community to focus on more\nchallenging and practical multilingual code generation scenarios."}

To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse\noffice applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our\nbenchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks\nderived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly\nsynthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential\ninformation from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step\nreasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation,\nwe propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation\nof long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration,\ntask generation, and dialogue synthesis.

Our experiments demonstrate\nthat current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to correctly follow the\ninstructions in LogicIFEval.

Our work here reveals a critical\nphenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the\nmiddle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this\nissue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal\nconsistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time\ndecoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select\nthe most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal\nConsistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a\nmeasure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward\nsignal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative\nTSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the\nCountdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we\nachieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and\n25.3% on Countdown, respectively. Our findings underscore the untapped\npotential of temporal dynamics in dLLMs and offer two simple yet effective\ntools to harness them."}
