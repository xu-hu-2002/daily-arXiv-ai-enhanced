Each expert spent over 100\nhours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the\nexperiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP\nresearchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after\nexecution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more\nthan expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,\neffectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human\nideas observed at the ideation stage.

There is also a growing expectation for them\nto display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this\nexpectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM\npersonalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity\nas a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable\npersonality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe\nthat changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related\ntraits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize\nmulti-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in\nisolation.

Recent approaches leverage transformer-based\narchitectures to predict speech activity continuously and in real-time. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel model that enables turn-taking prediction to be\ndynamically controlled via textual prompts. This approach allows intuitive and\nexplicit control through instructions such as \"faster\" or \"calmer\" adapting\ndynamically to conversational partners and contexts. The proposed model builds\nupon a transformer-based voice activity projection (VAP) model, incorporating\ntextual prompt embeddings into both channel-wise transformers and a\ncross-channel transformer. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach using\nover 950 hours of human-human spoken dialogue data. Since textual prompt data\nfor the proposed approach was not available in existing datasets, we utilized a\nlarge language model (LLM) to generate synthetic prompt sentences.

To\ncomplement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance\nby optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively\nunderexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering\ndata efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training\ndata organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data\nSelection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design\nLearnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which\nconsiders both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the\ngradient consistency perspective.
