To address this, we intent to improve\nthe multi-programming-lingual (MultiPL) performance of the base LLMs while\nretaining the most popular ones using restricted computational resources. We\nconsider MultiPL to be a special case of multiple natural languages and propose\na MultiPL extension of LLMs utilizing a hybrid mixture of experts (MoE), called\nMultiPL-MoE. Specifically, MultiPL-MoE combines two paired MoEs to optimize\nexpert selection at both the token and segment levels. The token-level MoE is a\nstandard upcycling MoE structure with a shared expert and a novel gate weight\nnormalization approach that aids in the final fusion with the segment-level\nMoE. The segment-level MoE incorporates two innovative designs to better\ncapture the syntactic structure and contextual patterns of programming\nlanguages: First, using a sliding window to partition the input token sequence\ninto multiple segments; Then, adopting an expert-choice routing strategy that\nallows experts to select the top-k segments.

However, these methods rely on\nfragile, implicit mechanisms often yielding inconsistent outputs across seeds,\nformats, or minor prompt variations making them fundamentally unreliable for\ntasks requiring stable, interpretable reasoning. In contrast, automata-based\nneuro-symbolic frameworks like RetoMaton offer a more structured and\ntrustworthy alternative by grounding retrieval in symbolic memory with\ndeterministic transitions. In this work, we extend RetoMaton by replacing its\nglobal datastore with a local, task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA),\nconstructed directly from external domain corpora. This local automaton\nstructure promotes robust, context-aware retrieval while preserving symbolic\ntraceability and low inference overhead.

Recent efforts\nto address this limitation often augment LLMs with an external memory bank, yet\nmost existing pipelines are static and heuristic-driven, lacking any learned\nmechanism for deciding what to store, update, or retrieve. We present\nMemory-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that equips LLMs with the\nability to actively manage and utilize external memory through two specialized\nagents: a Memory Manager that learns to perform structured memory operations\n{ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, NOOP}, and an Answer Agent that selects the most relevant\nentries and reasons over them to produce an answer. Both agents are fine-tuned\nwith outcome-driven RL (PPO and GRPO), enabling adaptive memory management and\nuse with minimal supervision. With as few as 152 question-answer pairs and a\ncorresponding temporal memory bank for training, Memory-R1 outperforms the most\ncompetitive existing baseline and demonstrates strong generalization across\ndiverse question types and LLM backbones.

However, their inference remains slower than that of\nautoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and\nthe large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this\nwork, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer\nconvergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by\nhalf steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and\nrandom remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99%\nof instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the\nrefinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a\ntraining-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding.\nSpecifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to\ngo \"all-in\" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the\nconfidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It\nintegrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible\noverhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of\nLLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the\nnumber of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation\nquality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop\nsampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet\npowerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing\nspeedup techniques.

In this work, we\nintroduce an Agentic Commonsense and Math benchmark (AgentCoMa), where each\ncompositional task requires a commonsense reasoning step and a math reasoning\nstep. We test it on 61 LLMs of different sizes, model families, and training\nstrategies. We find that LLMs can usually solve both steps in isolation, yet\ntheir accuracy drops by ~30% on average when the two are combined.

While recent MLLM\nadvancements show impressive performance on reasoning, their capacity for\nhuman-like spatial cognition remains an open question. In this work, we\nintroduce a systematic evaluation framework to assess the spatial reasoning\nabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs relative to human performance. Central to\nour work is 11Plus-Bench, a high-quality benchmark derived from realistic\nstandardized spatial aptitude tests. 11Plus-Bench also features fine-grained\nexpert annotations of both perceptual complexity and reasoning process,\nenabling detailed instance-level analysis of model behavior. Through extensive\nexperiments across 14 MLLMs and human evaluation, we find that current MLLMs\nexhibit early signs of spatial cognition. Despite a large performance gap\ncompared to humans, MLLMs' cognitive profiles resemble those of humans in that\ncognitive effort correlates strongly with reasoning-related complexity.\nHowever, instance-level performance in MLLMs remains largely random, whereas\nhuman correctness is highly predictable and shaped by abstract pattern\ncomplexity. These findings highlight both emerging capabilities and limitations\nin current MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and provide actionable\ninsights for advancing model design."}
