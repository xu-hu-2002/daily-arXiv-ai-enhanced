The present study addresses this question from the perspective of\nlexical diversity. Specifically, the study investigates patterns of lexical\ndiversity in LLM-generated texts from four ChatGPT models (-3.5, -4, -o4 mini,\nand -4.5) in comparison with texts written by L1 and L2 English participants (n\n= 240) across four education levels. Six dimensions of lexical diversity were\nmeasured in each text: volume, abundance, variety-repetition, evenness,\ndisparity, and dispersion. Results from one-way MANOVAs, one-way ANOVAS, and\nSupport Vector Machines revealed that the LLM-generated texts differed\nsignificantly from human-written texts for each variable, with ChatGPT-o4 mini\nand -4.5 differing the most. Within these two groups, ChatGPT-4.5 demonstrated\nhigher levels of lexical diversity despite producing fewer tokens. The human\nwriters' lexical diversity did not differ across subgroups (i.e., education,\nlanguage status). Altogether, the results indicate that LLMs do not produce\nhuman-like texts in relation to lexical diversity, and the newer LLMs produce\nless human-like texts than older models.

These changes are widely attributed\nto the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely\non a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target\naudience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are\noften linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to\ngenerate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes\nin the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a\ndataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from\nconversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends\nbefore and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated\nwords. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of\nthese words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and\nLLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no\nsignificant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of\nwords affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language\nuse. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by\nAI exposure remains an open question.

Current mainstream approaches primarily rely on the\n``LLM-as-a-judge\" paradigm, where an LLM is prompted to serve as an evaluator\nto assess dialogue quality.

To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as\njudges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment. Although\neffective, this multi-judge approach incurs significant computational overhead\nduring inference.

Their\nability to assume roles and personalities based on predefined character\nbiographies has positioned them as cost-effective substitutes for human\nparticipants in social science research. This paper explores the validity of\nsuch persona-based agents in representing human populations; we recreate the\nHEXACO personality inventory experiment by surveying 310 GPT-4 powered agents,\nconducting factor analysis on their responses, and comparing these results to\nthe original findings presented by Ashton, Lee, & Goldberg in 2004. Our results\nfound 1) a coherent and reliable personality structure was recoverable from the\nagents' responses demonstrating partial alignment to the HEXACO framework. 2)\nthe derived personality dimensions were consistent and reliable within GPT-4,\nwhen coupled with a sufficiently curated population, and 3) cross-model\nanalysis revealed variability in personality profiling, suggesting\nmodel-specific biases and limitations. We discuss the practical considerations\nand challenges encountered during the experiment. This study contributes to the\nongoing discourse on the potential benefits and limitations of using generative\nagents in social science research and provides useful guidance on designing\nconsistent and representative agent personas to maximise coverage and\nrepresentation of human personality traits."}

However,\ntraditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question\nanswering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability\nto handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG\nframework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions,\niteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and\ndynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning\ndiverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms\n(general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104\nexpert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and\nExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic\naccuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional\nonline RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized\nmodels (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models\n(e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B\nparameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally,\nagentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically\nrelevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even\nclinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g.,\nMedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of\nretrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic\nframeworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA,\nparticularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their\nclinical utility."}

In this study, we propose MMBERT, a novel BERT-based multimodal\nframework that integrates textual, speech, and visual modalities through a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. To address the instability associated\nwith directly integrating MoE into BERT-based models, we develop a progressive\nthree-stage training paradigm.

However, the\npractical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural\nconstraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static\nlength allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths\ncripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant\ncomputational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While\nthe inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses\ninternal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given\ntask. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce\nDAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive\nLength Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two\nphases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial\nlength and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided\nby a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL\ndynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation\nregions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully\ndeveloped. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves\nperformance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned\nfixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency\nby achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length\nconstraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap\nwith their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient\nand capable generation."}
